## Spring Is Here-What’s Springing Up Within You? (2010-03-16 00:38)

[1]
Its beginning to look like spring around my place. Plum trees and other bushes are beginning to bloom.
Upon closer observation of one my plum trees, I see several branches without any signs of spring. Instead
these branches are bare, while others around them are covered in blooms. It reminds me of how our lives
often are. Certain aspects of our lives can be blooming with newness like spring, while other parts seemingly
are in winter -the juxtaposition of being both the best of times and the worst of times. Thank God for a
master gardener that knows how to properly prune away every branch in us that produces not fruit and how
to lovingly nurture us until its our time to bloom. As you take in the sights of spring, take a little time to
observe the newness thats happening with you. Perhaps there’s new ideas/mindsets, new relationships or
new ministry opportunities. I pray that youll find new and greater levels of His presence, peace, joy, hope,
strength, faith and love springing up within you.

Isaiah 43:19a Look at the new thing I am going to do. It is already happening. Don’t you see it?
Father, open our eyes that we might me see what youre already doing among, within, and around us. We

thank you for the new thing that you are doing in our lives.Thank you for new understanding, new revela-
tions, and new mercies. In Jesus name. Amen

Living Water (2010-03-17 07:32:51)
I can understand the feeling of juxtaposed spring and winter very well. Not all things turns out the way we hope,
and even if we pray about it, certain things may be addressed for now, while others are still in waiting or may be
something we have to go through.
In all these, may we learn to understand that God knows His plans for us, for welfare and not for calamity to give us
a future and a hope (Jeremiah 29:11).
God bless.

## Any Mud on Your Soul? (2010-03-18 05:01)

[1]

I keep seeing the image of the Red Sea parted with walls of water piled on two sides with dry ground in the
middle. This image first came to my mind during Sunday’s praise and worship service. Not only was the
waters of the Red Sea parting a miracle but also that the Israelites didn’t encounter mud. In my own back
yard when it rains there are parts of the ground that remain wet and muddy several days after the rain has
gone. The ground beneath the Red Sea should have been muddy. And you know mud has a way of sticking
onto your shoes and getting tracked into places that you enter- uninvited nonetheless.

I believe some of us are entering into a season where God is going to ”clean away the mud” from our souls.
In places where our Red Sea has parted, He’s going to dry up the ground so that we’re no longer stuck. No
longer tracking the ”mud” of our past into our present or future. The Red Sea represents the hard places
He has moved you out of rather that be the pain of physical abuse, sexual abuse, bad relationships, lost of
a loved one, bad childhood, addictions, divorce, or whatever your Red Sea my have been. Funny thing is an
event can no longer be physically occurring but yet you carry it with you emotionally or psychologically like
mud on a shoe. Yet in places that you should have remained stuck or continued with muddy foot tracks,
even if no where else but in your mind, God is going to wash away the mud.

While reading an article from Prophetic Insights from Charisma by Nicki Pfeifer entitled, Five Keys for
2010, I was surprised and delighted to receive confirmation by the words she wrote regarding key #2 God is
releasing an anointing to leave your past behind. She writes, ”There is a special anointing for inner healing
this year. There is a release of grace in the body of Christ to finally put the pain of your past behind you.”

## Mindful Ponderings (2010-03-20 04:10)

My mind is pondering about peace. Are there certain images that come to mind when you hear the word
peace? What does biblical peace look like in comparison to worldly peace? Jesus declares that he left me a
gift of peace for John 14:27 says I am leaving you with a gift-peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give
isn’t like the peace the world gives. So don’t be troubled or afraid (NLT). A gift unopened or tucked away
is useless. Have I opened the gift or settled for a substitute?

## Hide & Seek (2010-03-22 14:00)

[1]

[2]Photo by SashaW

No point in HIDING from a God that knows how to SEEK you out, SURRENDER instead.

Psalm 139: 7-8 Where can I go to get away from your Spirit? Where can I run from you? If I go up to the
heavens, you are there. If I lie down in the grave, you are there. (NCV)
Thanks be unto you Lord for finding me when I didn’t even realize I was lost.

## Always Forever (2010-03-23 14:00)

Came across this verse while reading last night.
I see that the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken for he is right beside me. Acts 2:25b

Merriam Webster’s dictionary defines shaken as to lessen the stability of, to vibrate especially as the result
of shock or a blow or to dislodge. But this verse lets me know that even with the many circumstances that
life sometimes bring, I don’t have to be dislodged from my position in Him or become internally unstable
because I serve a God who is always there with me. One who will be the fourth man in the fire. He is one
that will come down to the pit or walk the waters of my storm to be with me.

Julie (2010-03-24 15:56:27)
Wanda, This beautiful truth is such a comfort, isn’t it.
So much swirls around sometimes in ways that just don’t make sense that without knowing He is with me I don’t
know if I’d make it...
Thank you for your visit to my blog and your sweet words left for me. You have blessed me!

LisaShaw (2010-03-30 00:42:28)
Amen and Praise the Lord!!!
I’m thankful that He is always with me and as such I shall not be moved. As I read Acts 2:25 (Acts being one of my
favorite Books in the Bible) it reminds me also of Isaiah 41:10.
God bless!!

## If Not Him, Then Who? (2010-03-29 11:01)

By golly, who knew that I’d find God at the zoo? Yes it’s true! If not Him, then who could have created such
animals? Although it wasn’t my first time to visit a zoo, I couldn’t help but be awed by the creativeness used
to design each of these animals. Some were big and others were small. Many displayed graceful elegance,
while others looked down right strange. As I looked around, I said to my sister if I’m created in God’s image
then He’s given me creativity as well and I’m convinced I have some that I’ve yet to use. Although, I don’t
understand the full significance in why each of the animals were shaped the way they were, I realize that
God did have a purpose for doing so. Each animal is equipped with what they need to survive and thrive in
the specific environments that they live.
Reminds me of us humans; we do not all look alike and each of us come packaged with our own unique set of
personalities, giftings, and abilities. Only God knew what each individual would need to survive and thrive
in the places He designed us to operate. Often times Im guilty of wishing I was a little bit more of this and
a little less of that but I have to mindful that Hes given be everything I need to accomplish His plan and
purpose for my life.

## Up for a Challenge (2010-03-31 20:29)

[1]
Although I have never been one to take on a dare (always been more of a play it safe kind of girl), one
challenge mentioned over at [2]Faith Hope & Love caught my attention. Arlee Bird at [3]Tossing It Out
has issued a challenge to fellow bloggers to blog using an A to Z theme for the month of April. So I have
decided to dive in and hopefully I will not sink. Some of those letters could be pretty tricky to navigate not
to mention that I don’t usually blog daily. But since it is a new year, I might as well try some new things,
huh. Be sure to check out [4]Tossing It Out for more details about the challenge. Now wish me luck as I
start tomorrow, April 1st, with a post relating to the letter ”A”.

## 1.2 April

## Ready, Set, Go (2010-04-01 10:25)

Well today kicks off the A-Z challenge. Todays theme is the letter A. Lots of a words come to mind but
the one sticking out to me at the moment is available. If you call my phone on a regular basis, from time
to time my answering machine is bound to pick up with a recording, which says sorry Im not available to
take your call right now but please leave a message. When calling others, one of the messages I dislike the
most is the mailbox is full please try your call later.
With the use of cell phones, instant messenger, and emails, ones ability to be reach has certainly been
expanded. Before the widespread use of such technology, the car was a quiet place to unwind from the days
happenings. Vacations were sacred getaways but now even there we are available to be reached. DVR and
TIVO make television programming available to be watched later at a more convenient time.
Merriam Websters online dictionary defines available as present and ready for immediate use. I cannot help
but wonder how many times God has attempted to reach me only to receive the message that Im not present
and ready to be used. I know that God can reach us anywhere. But just like there are times when my phone
rings and Im actually home but I dont hear it because Im busy being distracted by other things, I would
imagine there has been times when He tried to reach me. However, my spiritual ringer was turned too low
or perhaps I did not feel like talking and decided to let the answering machine pick up instead. Some calls,
television shows, blog posts, and emails we can afford to miss but being unavailable to God can leave us
void of valuable information for our lives. Wonder how many divine appointments I missed with the Father
because I was not available.
Father forgive me for the times I’ve let the cares of this world make me unavailable to you. Help me to not
only be present but ready to be used in service to you. Attune my ears that I might hear you. Thank you
for loving me enough to keep calling me back to you when you find that I have drifted away. Amen

The Alliterative Allomorph (2010-04-01 11:12:32)
Thanks for joining my blog :) Lovely post. One does wonder when we are ever going to be available nowadays. Our
lives are so choatic ...

arlee bird (2010-04-01 13:44:03)
It’s probably ridiculous, but my wife and I each have our cell phones and we have a land line– and nobody hardly
even calls us.
That should make me plenty available to pick up God’s calls. I know I don’t sometimes or just pretend I’m busy and
say ”I gotta run!”. I hope I’m doing better–I keep trying. That is an exceptionally important post for us to hear. A
very good way to start with the letter ”A”.
Thank you
Lee

Oh, girl. I had tears in my eyes by the end of your post. I love the way you used something we’ve all dealt with as a
lead-in to something many of us seldom think of!

ModernDayDrifter (2010-04-02 01:29:19)

Carol Conway-Fleisher (2010-04-02 02:22:46)
What a great post. All to often I am guilty of not being available when God tries to speak to me. Thanks for stopping
by my blog. I look forward to learning more about you during our blogging challenge.

Will Burke (2010-04-02 04:25:38)
Nice take on ”A.” Wouldn’t have thought of that! The trouble with ignoring our Maker is that it keeps getting louder!
It’s taught me to cultivate silence :)

Thanks for visiting my blog. I am just now reading as many blogs as I can. It is late at night (11 p.m.) and I am

unique way of looking at the ordinary.

## Bare But Not Barren (2010-04-02 05:01)

[1]

B is the letter for today. While out listening to the birds chirp as I waited for my Bella to take her potty
break, the phrase bare but not barren blew into my mind one winter morning. As I looked intently on the
beautiful bird perched in the tree, the unadorned branches of the tree caught my attention. It was still
winter so the trees nakedness was not unusual; it actually had a natural beauty to it. The tree was bare
but not necessarily barren. To the outward eye bare and barren can look the same. However, bare is to be
empty but barren is to lack the ability to produce. Just like the tree was bare (empty of leaves), there are
places in my life that are currently bare. The trees bareness was simply due to the season the tree was in.
It didnt signify the trees eternal state. Beneath the surface, the tree was connected to some life-nurturing
sustenance yet it had no outer appearance of growth. As you know seasons change and now that same tree
is now budding.
When I actually took the time to look up the definition of the two words it was in alignment with what
the spirit revealed. BARE= lacking a natural, usual or appropriate covering; open to view; unfurnished or
scantily supplied; devoid of amplification or adornment. BARREN= not reproducing; incapable of producing
offspring; habitually failing to fruit ; not productive; lacking interest or charm. Depending on the length of
time or the severity of your bareness, some people would have you inclined to believe that particular place in
your life is actually barren - it lacks the ability to produce fruitful relationships, ideas, or ministry. Therefore
be careful who you connect with during your bare seasons; otherwise you might find yourself disconnected
from the Source (the innate power within you to reproduce). Bare is momentary while barren can be for a
lifetime. Thank you Lord that every bare place in my life will produce fruit in its proper season.

What a great post. :)

Not enough hours! (2010-04-05 04:15:31)
Lovely post. It is so easy to confuse the two words, but there is a world of difference between them, isn’t it?

## Buried in Him (2010-04-03 03:38)

BURIED IN HIM

Today marks the day we remember them crucifying Jesus

and carrying Him away to be buried in the tomb.

When I think of the word bury, heaps of dirt marking a fresh grave comes to mind.

To bury marks an ending of what was and memorializes what now ceases to be.

When they crucified my Lord, they had no idea what significance that would be

to someone like you and me.

How could they have known that precious seed

would serve to set so many free

I heard a man of God say the most dangerous thing you can do to a seed is to bury it.

For there its greatest potential is released.

Beneath the ground beyond what they could see,

God was preparing a way for you and me.

Because they buried Him and He rose again,

my sins and bondages no longer have the power to imprison me.

When they buried Him, they made resurrection available to me

When they closed the tomb that day, they couldnt fathom

the way of escape made possible on that eventful day.

Because he was bruised and battered, theres healing here now for me

Because He was buried, I can now live freely

©W.Ward 2010

## Contractually Connected to a Covenant Keeping Christ (2010-04-03 07:00)

Ok, perhaps I went a little bit crazy with the c-words in my title. But oh contraire, it does complement
my post. Yes, I admit I confiscated the idea for this post while listening at Wednesday night Bible study.
Inspiration can certainly come from all sorts of places.
Employment agreements, marriages, mortgages, and car loans are a few of the many contracts we enter into
and dissolve in todays time. The terms or conditions of each one differ slightly but its function of connecting
two or more parties are the same. Each party agrees to offer or bring something to the deal. Thus each
reaping some benefit of sort. Before accepting job offers, we are told the salary, insurance policies, vacation
days, sick leave or other perks available. As the speaker pointed out in Bible study, we fully expect our
employer (flesh) to fulfill what was outlined in the contract. We place great confidence in mere humans (flesh
which is often fickle like you and me) that they will uphold their part of the deal.
If we can place such assurance in human contracts, as believers, how much more confidence should we have
in our covenant? A covenant sealed in the blood of Christ Jesus. A covenant made over 2000 years ago by
a God, who cannot lie. God, who remains the same today, yesterday, and forever more and who does not
change His mind. He is the one who remains faithful even when we are faithless.
In reading about covenant in the Nelsons Illustrated Dictionary of the Bible, I found this particular passage
interesting. A covenant, in the biblical sense, implies much more than a contract or simple agreement. A
contract always has an end date, while a covenant is a permanent arrangement. Another difference is that a
contract generally involves only one part of person, such as a skill, while a covenant covers a persons total
being. Isnt that just like our God, He goes beyond and makes provision for our whole being-mind, body,
soul, and spirit. When signing natural contracts, there is often some print we only glance over and soon
forget. Maybe its time to pull your covenant out and read through the pages again. You are sure to find
some provision in His Word that you have yet to partake.

C-Saturday is indeed a day for many C words. Christ sent his followers to fulful the great comission– how many are

stated a message that many should hear and heed.

The Voice (2010-04-03 16:50:26)
I must admit, that at the moment God and I are in deep negotiations. Obviously, somewhere in our contract I must
have misread and messed up somewhere. What I did to losea everything I haven’t figured out yet and I haven’t
understood what I was supposed to learn. Situations are smacking me hard and maybe I jumped a few paragraphs or
wasn’t listening clearly during the interview process. Anyway, I’m signed on for the Eternal Life deal and there is no
turning back.

Caledonia Lass (2010-04-03 20:50:58)
You know, the fact that commitment is lacking in society, even the smallest of commitments, is what makes things
we should cherish become so disposable.
Not only that, there are so many out there who don’t truly understand what a commitment is and just desire instant
gratification.
Great C post, Wanda and I’m very glad to meet you through the A-Z challenge. :D

## Time for Revisiting the Tomb (2010-04-04 03:42)

This is actually a repost from March but felt it fitting as we approach Easter.

[1]

I finished reading the book of Mark today. In Mark Chapter 16. We see Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary
the mother of James going back to the tomb to put some spices on Jesus’ body. In verse 3, it says that ”on
the way there they were discussing who would roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb. Yet we
know when they arrived at the tomb, they found the stone had ALREADY been ROLLED away. Like you,
I’ve heard or seen this passage of scripture many times and it’s often quoted/illustrated around Easter time.
However, today the Holy Ghost allowed me to see the text with fresh eyes and new application. I’m saved,
so I’ve already believed and confessed that Jesus died and rose again.

Yet, is there not some other things that are DEAD in our lives? Are not there some things that have been
BURIED and TUCKED AWAY in the recesses of our HEART and MIND? Some for many years. Some
things have been so deeply buried that we don’t even think about them often. Our emotions, heart, mind
have become deaden and we’ve longed since forgotten about there existence, if it were possible. When we
see these women in the beginning of chapter 16, they’re preparing to go say their FINAL goodbyes to Jesus.
They were going to put some sweet smelling stuff on a DEAD body -a DEAD Jesus. Jesus represents HOPE,
LIFE, LIGHT, HELP, SUPPORT as these are all the things He promised He was. Yet, now they find all
that DEAD but they were preparing to send it off smelling good. Not unlike what we do at times when
something we’ve hoped for, supported, or that brought light into our life fades away. We’ll dress it up we
sweet smelling phrases like , ”must not have been for me anyway”, ”I’m just fine”. However, they weren’t in
denial that Jesus was dead. And we don’t need to be either. Reality is that some things DIED in us, around
us, and even through us.

Just as the women went back to the tomb, we need the courage to revisit some tombs in our lives. Their
expectation when revisiting the tomb was to put some things to rest. Probably expected to leave in MOURN-
ING and ANGUISH. Unexpectedly, the stone had already been move d away, while they were attempting
to ponder how they were going to get the thing done. Some of us are pondering within our selves, ”how
am I going to get past this” but if we’ll muster up the courage to not only revisit the tomb but ENTER
in the places that’s been BURIED/TUCKED AWAY. We will find that the experience WILL NOT be the
same. RESURRECTION POWER had visited the tomb! Just like Mary and the other ladies, instead of
leaving the tomb in SORROW, we’ll leave in AMAZEMENT and JOY. The Holy Spirit is unctioning us to
REVISIT the TOMBS of dead DREAMS, RELATIONSHIP, HOPE, JOY, LOVE, PASSION, PROMISES
or whatever may be dead in your life, and TRY AGAIN. The RESURRECTOR has already gone before you
to MOVE the STONE away and He promises that it absolutely will not be the same. EXPECT some thing
different because DIVINE RESURRECTION has already ARRIVED but you must go to the place you left
it.

Father, I pray that you’ll give us the courage to go back to those places in our lives that we’ve locked away
and given up hope of any change. Out of obedience to your word and by the power of the Holy Ghost, we
move believing that the place may be the same but what we encounter will not be. Thank you for moving

us past places and things in our lives that was too hard for us. Thank you for moving us past old hurts, old
mind sets, old baggage, old hang ups. We thank you for resurrecting life, love, hope, joy, passion in us. In
Jesus Name-Amen
Happy Resurrection Day!

## D is the Day (2010-04-05 05:01)

D-day has dawned and I found myself in a dilemma. Didn’t quite know what to decide. Do I discuss delicious
desserts, determined dedication, dreadful driving habits, or daring Daniel. I dare not go on. So after much
deliberation, I have chosen to designate the day as doggy day. Yep, I’ve chosen to detour from deeper topics
and instead deal with my dear dog Bella.
Sweet little girl was deserted at the pound. And since the day I discovered her, she has brought such delight.

[1]

First day at her new home

She detects the faintest sound and dashes to the door in record time.

Occasionally dines on paper and other strange dishes.

And she definitely has a deafening high pitched shrill.

[2]

Someone did away with my coat

Loves to dangle her head outside the car door and is ever satisfied to cling to my side.

From time to time, she even lets me dress her and does not dare complain.

[3]

Do I have to wear the sweater?

Check out other A-Z challenge participants [4]here.

## The Eyes Have It (2010-04-06 05:10)

[1] [2][3]When you look into the mirror, what color are the eyes peeking back at
you&hazel, blue, brown, green, gray, black or perhaps a little red from all the blog reading? Throughout
my life, I’ve been said to have dreamy or sleeping eyes. Eyes come in all shapes and sizes but there essential
purpose remains the same-to see.

However, several people looking at the exact same scene often see very different things. Such is the case of
many of the people in Bible times (just as we are today). The deeply religious Pharisees and Saducees were
exposed to the same teachings and miracles of Jesus. Yet they were unable to see that He was indeed the
Messiah in which they searched the Scriptures. Even the disciples were privy to close encounters with Jesus
seeing first hand his many wonderous works but on several occasions He rebuked them for not being able
to perceive who He was really. Looking and seeing does not automatically translate into perceiving what
is seen. Matthew 13: 13-14 This why I speak to them in parables: Though seeing they do not see; though
hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: You will be ever hearing
but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.

I’ve worn glasses or contacts for several years due to a condition called myopia or nearsightedness as it’s
commonly known. Myopia is a condition in which one can see things close up but things at a distance
appear blurred. Another definition of myopia is a lack of discernment or long range perspective in thinking
or planning. Reminds me of how sometimes in life , we’re so busy looking at the everyday things that we fail
to see the glorious works of God being displayed before our eyes. It was myopia, that prevented the woman
at the well from seeing Jesus as the source of everlasting water. Enveloped with daily struggles, myopia
prevents me from perceiving they are producing endurance, character, and hope within me.

And what about those who are always looking into the future, planning for a later date and time. Waiting
before enjoying, encouraging, or enlightening themselves and others. Certainly preparation for the future is
important but not so much that it eludes us of partaking in today’s blessings and joys.

So how does one correct their eyesight so that they’re not just looking but perceiving. The Message’s
translation of Matthew 6:22-23 offers a few suggestions like opening your eyes in wonder and belief. Distrust
and greed causes distorted vision. Essentially being open and receptive leads to more understanding.

The Alliterative Allomorph (2010-04-06 06:30:12)
Personally I believe eyes are overrated. As you say, many of us just ’look’ rather than ’perceive’. This is so true.
Eyes may allow us to see, but what we truely perceive comes from our hearts. We need to make use of all of our other
senses and instincts to see what’s really ahead of us.
To me, eyes are just like the amber traffic light. They warn us, caution us, but they do not tell :)
Beautiful post.

Mike (2010-04-06 07:44:52)

WELCOME TO MY WORLD OF POETRY: (2010-04-06 09:52:58)

I find about eyes if a person can’t look you staight into your eyes they have something to hide. Eye contact is very
importanr to me.
Take care.
Yvonne.

Pet (2010-04-06 16:36:33)
Interesting. God bless.
```

```
LaVonne (2010-04-06 19:07:57)
Amen! It is tragic, in the spirit and in the natural, to see without really seeing and observing and taking in what is
in the line of vision. Sight is a line, not a dot...it is long, it points toward. Sight is a beginning of a thing, not an end.
Continue speaking the Word in this time of famine of the Word.
LaVonne
```

```
Raquel Byrnes (2010-04-06 19:39:02)
That was a great post. I loved the way you started out with eye color, moved onto types of vision, and then likened
it all to spiritual perception. Nice work.
```

```
Tori Cooper (2010-04-07 00:09:46)
Great job on your E post! Excellent insight on perception... sometimes we get so caught up in what we ”can” see that
we forget to use our other senses... another great verse is 2 Corinthians 5:7 We live by faith not by sight... :-)
```

```
Wanda (2010-04-07 00:47:02)
That is another good scripture indeed Tori.
```

Interesting analogy alitterative regarding the amber caution light. Thanks for all the encouraging words LaVonne,

## F is for F.A.M.I.L.Y. (2010-04-07 10:06)

Short or tall. Young or old. Big or small. We all were born into some type of family of sort. The composition
of families in society has changed. Dynamics in families vary but having a family provides us with a few
fundamental ingredients.
Foundation: Families provide us with a foundation for trust and developing relationships with others. There
we learn the fundamental skills needed to forge into the future. Who we become is built upon the experiences
we had as children.
Faith: Church and faith has been a part of my life as far back as I can remember. It was through fierce
determination of my mother that my siblings and I grew up with the knowledge of the Heavenly Father. All
those times spent in Sunday School, YPWW, and even choir practice (which I soooo dreaded) was sowing
seeds of faith that would reap an eternal harvest within me.
Fun and Fond Memories: Just during ordinary days I’ve share so many laughs and good times with my
family. And holidays bring back fond memories of Christmas, Thanksgiving, Fourth July, and Easter past.
My extended family has a habit of gathering on any and every occasion.
Fan Club: It has been my family that has cheered me on from award ceremonies, graduations, and birthdays.
There has not been one occasion that someone was not there encouraging me.
Families are often filled with faults as well. As I was reading a post over at [1]Coffee Rings Everywhere about
the author’s father, I couldnt help but feel a tinge of sadness that I don’t recall any such tender moments
with my dad. Dysfunction in families is nothing new simply read your Bible and you’ll find some major feuds
and favoritism in families. We are unable to choose our natural families, but we all have to opportunity to
become a part of a much greater family-God’s family.
P. S. Trying to come up with posts for the A-Z challenge has been fun and frightening. Find other F-related
posts [2]here.

Very true that we can not select our natural families and often there are situations (dysfunctions and large hurts which
I experienced growing up) that happen but I’m grateful for being a part of the Family of Christ! Being adopted into
ABBA’s Family through Jesus Christ is awesome!
Thanks for sharing!

Your post reminded me of what my mother told me when I got engaged. She told me ”you can’t choose your family,
but you can choose your spouse, and you only live with your family for 18 years or so, but you will live with your
husband for the rest of your life.” And marrying my husband was the best decision I’ve ever made. Thanks for sharing!

## Are You Growing? (2010-04-08 05:15)

[1]

Oh my gosh, I must admit lately I’ve been feeling like a girl back in grade school working hard to get my
A-Z challenge assignments completed. I could never be glad with an incomplete. Gees let’s get to my post.
Babies, flowers, and definitely my grass seem to grow so fast. I’ve been reflecting on those things needed to
ensure healthy growth in our lives. Using each letter of the word grow, I discovered some helpful things to
help our spirtitual lives bloom.
G-for Ground. The ground or the type of soil we’re planting in hampers or helps the seeds sown. Jesus,
Himself illustrated through the parable of the sower the impact the ground of our hearts have on the Word
in our lives.
R-for Rain. Just as plants require water, we need the rain of his presence to fall upon us. Life has a way of
leaving us burdened, burned, and bare. Searching for water sources to quench our thirst leads us to broken
relationships, food addictions, alcohol and drug abuse, promiscuity. All promising to quench our dry places
but only leaving us more drained and parched than before.
O-for Opportunities and Obstacles. Yes, I did say obstacles. Obstacles and opportunities for growth present
themselves in very obscure ways. Trials and tribulations produce (if there is production, there is growth)
something within us according to Romans 5:3 We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials,

for we know that they are good for us. They help us learn to endure. And endurance develops strength of
character in us, and character strengthens our confident expectation of salvation. So the next time you find
yourself facing and obstacle, remind yourself that you have been granted an opportunity to grow.
W-for Weapons. Oh indeed you need some weapons if you’re going to grow. Any good farmer or gardener has
specific tools that help him cultivate the ground and gather the harvest. And the devil is just like pests are to
plants, he comes to infect and ultimately destroy your growth. Therefore, appropriate pesticides(weapons)
are needed. Being as gracious as He is, God has prepared armor for you to wear so that you might stand
against the wiles of the devil. 2 Corinthians 10:4 tells us The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of
the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. (NIV)
I pray that the ground of your heart is soft and receptive to God. And when you find that you are harden
that you’ll allow the rain of His presence to make you supple again. When obstacles and opportunities come
along, may you not shrink back in fear but fearlessly forge ahead knowing that God is right at your side and
that His equipped you with the weapons to overcome.

Such a beautiful post. As I go through a time of growth in my spiritual life right now, I can so relate to what you’ve

Him. I read another post similar in content to that just the other day. Maybe He’s telling me something?

Thank you so much for this post. I am on my personal A to Z challange of thankfulness and slightly regretting it as I
have limited myself so much in my decision to make the word something I am grateful for; especially as I am getting
to the end with the ’hard’ letters. This post was just what I needed to encourage me to keep going and also to focus
on the scriptures you gave RE obsticles and weappons.

## Power in Your Hands (2010-04-09 06:00)

[1]

Photo Credit: [2]Nojahn via Flickr

With my hands I shuffle endless heaps of paper at work, add my signature to notes, wash dishes, fold piles
of laundry, and click through my favorite channels with the remote. I use these hands to pat Bella and fill
her doggy dishes. Through these same hands money passes to pay bills. And often within their grip is the
latest book or Bible verse I’m reading. Each of these ordinary and seemingly insignificant tasks keeps my
hands busy. But could this be all that God had in mind for these hands of mine?
You’ve probably read the poem entitled, Whose Hands It’s In, if not I’ve included at the bottom of the post.
Through the hands of a murderer like Moses, God placed deliverance for a whole nation. In the hands of a
persecutor like Paul, God placed healing for many. The hands of a little shepherd boy like David laid the
assassination of a giant named Goliath. God placed a baby born to be the Savior of the world in the hands
of a virgin girl named Mary. In the hands of fishermen, Christ placed the authority and power to spread the

Gospel. The hand of one blogger with a single idea was able to unite bloggers across hemispheres to join
an A-Z Challenge. In the hands of a scared farmer named Gideon, God placed the ability to be a rescuer.
These were all ordinary people, whom God choose to use, going about their daily lives. But how did the
insignificant become a candidate for such inspiring and honorable feats? They simply chose to place their
hands in God’s hand.
Now go ahead and take a look at those hands of yours and know that God wants to use those hands as well.
Father we not only place our hands in your hands but our whole lives as well.
Whose Hands it’s In.
A basketball in my hands is worth about $19.
A basketball in Michael Jordans hands
Is worth about $33 million.
It depends Whose hands its in.
A baseball in my hands is worth about $6.
A baseball in Mark Mcquires hands
Is worth $19 million.
It depends Whose hands its in.
A tennis racket is useless in my hands.
A tennis racket in Pete Sampras hands
Is a Wimbledon Championship.
It depends Whose hands its in.
A rod in my hands will keep away a wild animal.
A rod in Moses hands
Will part the mighty sea.
It depends Whose hands its in.
A sling shot in my hands is a kids toy.
A sling shot in Davids hand
Is a mighty weapon.
It depends Whose hands its in.
Two fish and 5 loaves of bread in my hands
Is a couple of fish sandwiches.
Two fish and 5 loaves of bread in Gods hands
Will feed thousands.
It depends Whose hands its in.
Nails in my hands might produce a birdhouse.
Nails in Jesus Christs hands
Will produce salvation for the entire world.
It depends Whose hands its in.
So put your concerns, your worries, your fears,
Your hopes, your dreams, your families
And all your relationships into Gods hands.
Because as you can see
It matters Whose hands their in.

## Imposter on the Loose (2010-04-10 23:31)

[1]

According to statistics identity theft is on the rise. One report states that one in four households in the US
is affected by it. While certain age groups have higher incidences of id theft, it happens to people from all

walks of life. Encarta dictionary defines identity as the name or essential character that identifies somebody
or something; the set of characteristics that somebody recognizes as belonging uniquely to himself or herself
and constituting his or her individual personality for life.

What things or characteristics do you identify with yourself? There is a song I listen to from time to time
by Lacrae called Identity. The words of the chorus are:

```
I’m not the shoes I wear, I’m not the clothes I buy
I’m am not the house I live in, I’m not the car I drive
I’m not the job I work, You can’t define my worth
By nothing on God’s green earth, my identity is found in Christ.
```

I believe one of the greatest thefts in the body of Christ is stolen identities. The enemy fights hard to keep
us locked away from the truth of who God has called us to be. As long as we don’t know who we are and
the power and authority that he has placed within these earthen vessels, the enemy is able to steal, kill, and
destroy our love ones, our hopes, passions, and faith. Keeping us chained to our old man thus rendering us
ineffective in the kingdom of God. Our true identity can only be found by fellowshipping with the Creator.

you nailed this one, Wanda! i was here a few month’s after losing it ALL to the enemy. one of the problems when
this happened to me was when i got back into sin, it was ten times worse to get out of then before. what a lot of
people fail to recognize is that the enemy really wants to kill us literally not figuratively. if he can’t get to us, he will
use someone closer to us. abiding is my only hope!

Wanda (2010-04-11 01:31:04)
Oh yes, he’s a real enemy who aims to complete his assignment by any means necessary.

I read your profile and loved it. You’re right. The Father would not have given us the Dream if He did not want us
to follow it with all our heart.
If you have the time and inclination, would you check out my entry in the murder scene blogfest. It is a historical
fantasy, set in 1853 aboard a transatlantic steamer bound for Paris. 1853 where morality was as razor-edged for men
of principle as it is now.

Good choice for I-day. If my ID card has heaven as my ”home address”, do people who know me and ”look” at my ID

Gregg (2010-04-11 12:32:13)
Good post and great analogy! We do need to know who we are in Christ. Although we have a large part in the
responsibility of knowing this, the fault lies with poor teaching on the part of biblical teachers. We have such a
shortage of them today and it the problem continues to grow worse.

Wanda (2010-04-11 13:21:24)
@Raquel-thanks
@Roland, thanks for stopping by and when I get a moment I’ll be sure to stop by your place.
@Linda, good point, I was reading a scripture the other day and was pondering the same thing about self.
@Gregg, true we perish due to lack of knowledge.

Great post Wanda. I read the last paragraph twice so that I could fully grasp what you were saying, with my heart.

So true what you say... we got to get to the point where we believe what God says we are instead of all those lies...
the bible says Satan is the father of lies... although it is easy to believe them... freedom lies behind truth... They
shall know the truth, and the truth shall set them free! JOHN 8:32 God’s word is truth (JOhn 17;17)

## Capturing the Journey (2010-04-12 05:01)

A place to reflect on days gone by...
A safe place to dream and envision life as I wish it could be...
A place to juggle my thoughts and release the rage or disappointment within...
A journal has been my place to release all the rumblings in my head for quite some time.
When I was much younger, I wrote in it daily but find that now days, weeks, and sometimes even months go
by without writing in my journal. It’s interesting to read back through my journal to see how I’ve progressed
in my journey through life. So many of the things I was once consumed with now have little significance in
my life. Other things that I thought I never could get through I found that God has moved me pass. Its
the place I write the whisperings from God and in times of drought, reviewing them makes my heart glad to
recall the promises Hes spoken. How do you document your lifes journey?

I have a cardboard box full of journals from the past 30 years or so. Sometimes it’s fun (and funny) to pull one out
and read some of the things that were happening at the time. It is strange how some worries were so petty and some
wishes were so shallow. And it is bittersweet to see my family and my life’s story bloom from the pages.
Sadly, I haven’t kept a journal (other than my blogs) for several years now.

I love reading my journals, it gives me mix feelings, well, it depends on what journal I come across with and read.
I have many journals but never used all the pages.. I just can’t seem to be faithful in writing and documenting my
daily life.

arlee bird (2010-04-12 18:59:06)
Journaling really is a great idea. I’ve tried doing it at times, but never keep up with it. I guess my documentation
of my life’s journey is a hodgepodge of random writings, photographs, video, letters, and all of the miscellania that I
tend to keep.
Good word for J.

I used to journal constantly but sadly, have gotten away from it. I’d like to start again after the baby is born...I think

look back and see how faithful God was...even if I didn’t feel it at the time.

I never really felt the call to journal when I was younger. When I first began blogging a journal was all I doing it for.

## K is for King (2010-04-13 06:00)

When I think of the letter k, king is the first word that comes to mind. Attired in royal robes and commanding
His subjects is the picture I see of a King. A king governs with power and authority. He’s one who is served
and doesn’t entertain the common folk. Instead he dines with other rulers and leading authorities.
Yet I’m reminded how so many people in Bible times missed the King of kings because He didn’t come
packaged in the stately garments in which they expected. Rather than glitz and glamour, my King arrived
on earth’s scene in a plain and humble manner. He didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in His mouth but as
the son of an ordinary carpenter. The kingdom He came to establish was not about lording over others or
seeking positions of grandeur. Instead he taught that servanthood is the way to true greatness.
Grateful that He chose to utilize the ordinary, mundane, often-overlooked people in society to advance His
Kingdom. Otherwise, there would be no hope for a girl like me. His kingdom is not based on race, age, or
economic status but open to all who will believe and confess. Matthew 21:32 John came to show you the
right way to live. You did not believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. Even after
seeing this, you still refused to change your ways and believe him. Have you accepted the invitation to be a
part of the Kingdom? If not, there’s still time left.

## Lifting the Labels (2010-04-14 14:15)

[1]

Clothing, cars, bottles, bags, boxes, purses, shoes, and cans are just of the few places that you can find a
label. There are designer labels and others are just generic names. Companies spend big bucks trying to
market their labels so their brand stands out. When we see a particular label or logo, we instantly recognize
the company that produces the product. Amazingly before children are even able to read, they know those
golden arches means McDonalds is nearby. We don’t have to see the words Nike but that little swoosh sign
easily makes the shoes recognizable.
Labels serve to describe something or identify an item, its contents or manufacturer. And we associate
certain characteristics with a specific label thus defining its value or potential. However, labels also limit our
expectancy. If a can is labeled as corn, we don’t expect to open it and find green beans. In life sometimes we
acquire labels that attempt to define us and affect our perception of ourselves and others. Teachers might
have labeled you has dumb. Maybe, your family called you the black sheep. Of course, not all labels are
negative. Whether the label is smart, youre just like your father, or you’re no good, those who have been
labeled find themselves living out those labels at times. I remember reading about an experiment with a
group of students. Divided into two groups, one group of students labeled as smart and the other as average.
Surprisingly, each groups academic performance was at the level they had been identified.
It reminds of the story of Jacob in the Bible. His own mother gave him a name that means trickster, deceiver
or supplanter (to take the place of another through force, scheming/strategy) and he certainly fulfilled that
role. Not only did he steal his brothers birthright but also his blessing. But the good news is that although
labels sure have a way of sticking to us, they don’t have to be attached for a lifetime. Just like Jacob was
given a new name (Israel) so do we when we accept Christ as Savior. No longer am I stuck living out labels
or stuck in sin. For He gives me a new label of overcomer, chosen, righteous... just to name a few.
My mom being the recycler that she is often reuses jars and although she would remove the label, they
hardly ever all came off at one time. Even after repeated washings, parts of the label would still be attached.
As believers we are the same way, having lived much of our lives with certain labels, we dont always find it
easy to lift the labels of our past and walk in the freedom of our new labels. But as we continue to bathe
our minds in His Words and declare what He says about us, those old labels will lose their stickiness.

2 Corinthians 5:17 Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person. The past is forgotten, and everything is
new. (CEV)
2 Corinthians 5: 16-17 Because of this decision we don’t evaluate people by what they have or how they
look. We looked at the Messiah that way once and got it all wrong, as you know. We certainly don’t look at
him that way anymore. Now we look inside, and what we see is that anyone united with the Messiah gets a
fresh start, is created new. The old life is gone; a new life burgeons! (The Message)

Wanda, Bravo, this is so well done!
Sad, but true! You brought so much to the table with the label. I loved it! I recycle and can relate to removing the
labels. We as a society need to stop summing people up with labels. There are many facets to a personality and
people’s talents. Great post!
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-04-14 15:08:13)
Wanda, it is all so true and sad. Many opportunities are missed when we look at labels. We miss the chances to give
and receive.
May we continue to do all to God’s glory.

True. I lived with a label growing up that made my life very hard. I’m still fighting it because family originated it,

## My Mind is Pondering (2010-04-15 06:30)

[1]

”M” is the letter of the day for the [2]A-Z Challenge. I considered mentioning mothers and even money
matters. But the subject of marriage has my mind mesmerized at the moment. Not because I’m some expert
in the matter but as a young, single, professional Christian woman, I’m concerned about getting it right.
The fact that so many marriages, even among Christians, today end in divorce is rather alarming to me.
Understandably being Christian doesn’t exempt one from the pressures and challenges that any marriage
faces, I’ve just always believe that somehow two Christians entering marriage could certainly beat the odds.

So my questions is to those of you who are happily hanging in marriage, what’s the secret (for the lack of a
better word) to making marriage work? Or what tools are essential to having a happy marriage?

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-04-15 13:36:15)
Hello Wanda! Marriage...what a word to think on. Trust is the core. We can’t have a relationship with God if we
can’t trust Him, and we can’t have a marriage without trust.
Trust in marriage begins long before the marriage. Each person must have developed a trusting relationship with
God. That trust in God gives us what we need to make wise decisions, including that critical decision of who we
should marry. TRUST, TRUST & TRUST! Without it, there is no honesty, no humility, no Godly submission, no
love. There must be trust.
```

```
arlee bird (2010-04-15 14:52:00)
As one who is on his 3rd marriage I might not seem like the go to guy on this topic. Believe me, I was not happy
about any of my divorces and would have never let them happen if it had been totally up to me. I think divorce laws
should be much more rigid and biblical.
Aside from the good advice given so far I would add extreme patience and commitment. 1 Corinthians chapter 13
should be the study guide for you and any prospective partner before you enter into a marriage and throughout the
partnership.
I hope you find the partner you deserve and that when you go into the contract that it is intended for life. Divorce is
one of the worst things I’ve ever had to deal with and I don’t recommend it for anyone.

...disqualify myself to answer this one:)
but agree 100 % with what Lee said AND experienced...

```
Shannon (2010-04-15 15:54:54)
There is no secret, love each other the way God teaches you to do in His word, don’t just give 50 % of yourself to your
mate, give 100 % of yourself to the marriage...communicate every day, it is a wonderful tool...lol...men cannot read
our minds, so don’t make them, tell them what you want because they really don’t know..we are wired emotionally,
men are wired visually, it’s a fact, God made them that way! These are my secrets, if you want to call them that, to
a wonderful marriage!
```

Linda (2010-04-15 17:30:32)
Commitment. Start like you want to finish - together. And everything Lee said.

Faith Imagined (2010-04-15 18:58:45)
I agree with everything. I also want to add that you be physically intimate with your hubby as much as possible. He
will greatly appreciate this advice!

Tori Cooper (2010-04-15 22:04:24)
Totally agree with Shannon and Faith Imagined... unfortunately no one is exempt from tough times. So it is important
to remember we all have to fight to keep the marriage healthy and strong.
Marriage is hard work and not for the weary. My husband & I decided at the very beginning that if we married,
divorce wasn’t an option, that we would do whatever we could to make it work, and we would always put Christ in
the center of our relationship.
We believe that marriage is a full time ministry in itself. I am called to minister to my husband and he to me... as
long as we are keeping our minds on loving Jesus and loving each other... all is well.
Some Christians run off elsewhere to participate in ”ministry” neglecting their #1 ministry- their family. A family
starts when a man & woman marry not when they have children. I guess that’s why Paul remained single- so he could
focus on saving the world and not have to worry about saving his marriage. Marriage is not for everyone. There is a
great book out there by Dr. Emerson called ”Love & Respect”... boils it down to two basic needs... a women generally
needs to feel loved and a man generally need to feel respected. Check it out sometime. :-D

Wanda (2010-04-15 23:46:00)
All such good advice. Thanks for sharing guys. I’ll have to check that book out, Tori.

Mary McDonald (2010-04-16 00:00:35)
This year, I’ll be married 25 years. I wish I had some secret, but I don’t. I guess it’s mostly being committed and
realizing that that there are going to be rough patches but that there will be good times too.

Since I’m divorced Wanda, I really have no right to address this question, but I do feel like I know the answer. When
my husband (ex) and I allowed ourselves to fall away from God and started doing our own thing, our marriage fell
apart. If Christ is the center of ANYTHING you do, everything will be okay.

Living Water (2010-04-16 01:34:48)
I guess it’s about truth, trust, tolerance, communication, commitment, companionship, communion, and completeness.
Personally, it has much to do with accepting one another for who we are inspite of.
I love my wife and I am still growing in love for her even after 20 years. We do things together and we hide nothing
from each other. We share and communicate in times of joy and in times of sorrow, in prosperity and in poverty,
to hold each other up and to go through difficult times together, without forgetting to be thankful to God always,
knowing He is always in control.
As in the marriage vow, it is being there for each other to have and to hold, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,
in sickness or in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.

I have been married 25 yrs... The secret is to have your own hobbies, respect for one another and marry
a sailor, they go away a lot. I’m kidding, though it is true. We probably have been together only 15 yrs. It is a give
n’ take relationship, sometimes you have to take the high road. It takes a lot of faith, trust and communication.

Kathleen (2010-04-21 05:55:31)
I have pondered this often what makes a good marriage. I have been married for almost 17 years now.
Most of these keys have already been mentioned but I just wanted to agree: a 100 % commitment; it is not a 50-50
deal. Each of you has to give 100 %.
Communication and an ability to resolve conflict. A good sense of humor! Laugh a lot together. When times were
tough and we needed to communicate – my husband also needed (and so did I but didn’t know it) was to go have
FUN together and laugh and remember how & why we fell in love.
We have had to make each other a priority, especially in these season of kids and high-demand in careers. Sitting next
to each other (not letting children between), once-a-month date nights, talking with each uninterupted when kids are
awake (small increments of time).
And prayer, the grace of God, godly examples of long marriages (both my husband & I have great examples in our
parents & grandparents, etc).
I also highly recommend marriage conferences at all seasons of life. They usually get you talking about topics that
are easy to go undiscussed especially because a spouse gets defensive when you bring it up. But here the conference
people said to talk about THIS and so you’re talking about THIS because they said to not because one of you had an
agenda and that helps.
The Love & Respect book is good. I recommend that as well.

Realistic expectations. Honeymoon infatuation and the chills don’t last and aren’t designed to. Expect lots of ordinary
days. You will – and should – argue / discuss, because you will have conflicts – you’re two different people. Toss out
the fairy tale ideals, and set your sights on ”good enough,” with gratitude.
We’ve been married thirteen years. I wouldn’t call it a fabulous, thrilling, inspirational marriage, but it’s good enough.
We are committed, we keep trying to stay connected and to trust God and one another and to forgive. We’ve both
made lots of progress in accepting each other and the chronic conflicts we have, and accepting baby steps instead of
sweeping changes. There are still dark days, but we trust.

## Never Say Never (2010-04-16 07:00)

NEVER...not ever; at no time, not in any degree, not under any condition. Have you ever found yourself
using the word never? Nope not ever going to do that again. Under no condition will I do this or that.
When I was in college there was certainly some courses, I didn’t think I’d ever use. One such course I did
everything possible to avoid, but as luck would have it, I was force to take a certain social gerontology course
due to scheduling conflicts. Well I had NO intentions of ever using the material from the course BUT for
the past 8 or 10 years I’ve been working in the field of aging. NEVER saw that coming.
So much in my life hasn’t quite turned out the way I expected. But I find comfort in knowing that although
I don’t always know the way that I’m to take, I serve a God who had a plan for me (and you) before I was

even formed in my mother’s womb. And His plan is good and not evil. I’m learning to trust Him more and
more to lead me and not seek my own way.
And to use another n-word NEW. I would like to say thanks to all the new followers. It’s been such a pleasure
getting to read all the new blogs, I’ve discovered through the [1]A-Z challenge.

Will Burke (2010-04-16 11:28:30)

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-04-16 16:23:31)
Wanda, I laughed as I read your post. I tend to say NOPE, NO and NEVER to stuff that doesn’t seem to fit my
purpose, but I’ve learned along the way that the stuff I’m trying to reject is exactly what is in God’s plan for me.
Love above all.

Linda (2010-04-16 18:16:39)

end.

Gregg (2010-04-17 00:02:09)

this universe!

## Open to Opportunity (2010-04-17 15:02)

Opportunities are around us daily. Opportunities to choose joy over sadness, to try something new over
being stuck in the mundane, to walk in obedience, to touch the life of someone else, or to share the good
news of the Gospel. Chances to rejoice rather than complain are available. Occasions to smile instead of
frown. You know opportunities, big or small; our lives are full of them.
When I look back over my life, I wonder just how many opportunities have I missed. Much of my life has
been lived out confined into a small, safe box, in a way. Having been the shy, introverted type didnt lend
itself to exploring new frontiers. Stifled by the fear of rejection and insecurities, I lost chances to meet and
fellowship with new people. At times, I failed to obey the voice of God, preventing Him from revealing
Himself to me in new ways. Immobilized by the fear of failure or fear of what others might think, I didnt
take the chance of engaging in new activities. Being so self-absorbed and consumed with the what-ifs, I
neglected to share a word of encouragement that could have rendered aide to a fellow brother or sister.
I heard a lady once say that Passing Over Opportunities Repeatedly leaves you POOR. And I must agree.
Hearing the word poor, we might immediately think of it economic terms but it simply means less than what
is normal, necessary, or desirable; or low quality. Not seizing opportunities for new relationships can leave
you with a low quality of companionship and less than normal chances for growth. For iron sharpens iron.
As we walk in obedience, our faith increases. Lately, Ive began to step out in small areas of obedience and
Ive seen my confidence in not only Gods willingness to use me but His great desire to use me in service to
Him. He wants to use me, despite my insecurities and my personal temperament.
You may find that like me, you have overlooked a few opportunities. Dont despair. Every day that you
awaken you are given the chance to begin again. The same ones do not always come around again but rest
assured that if youre living, God is opening doors of opportunity to you each and every day. Its up to us
what we do with them.
I found a few keys in maximizing opportunities:
1) Conquering fear some things you have to do afraid.
2) Being alert/aware- live consciously knowing that opportunities are available daily
3) Obeying Gods voice/word
4) Preparation  its too late to get prepared when opportunities present themselves.
A few scriptures to meditate on regarding opportunities:
Galatians 6:10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong
to the family of believers. (NIV)
Ephesians 5:11-16 Don’t waste your time on useless work, mere busywork, the barren pursuits of darkness.

Expose these things for the sham they are. It’s a scandal when people waste their lives on things they must
do in the darkness where no one will see. Rip the cover off those frauds and see how attractive they look in
the light of Christ.
Wake up from your sleep,
Climb out of your coffins;
Christ will show you the light!
So watch your step. Use your head. Make the most of every chance you get. These are desperate times!
(The Message)
Colossians 4:4-6 Pray diligently. Stay alert, with your eyes wide open in gratitude. Don’t forget to pray for
us, that God will open doors for telling the mystery of Christ, even while I’m locked up in this jail. Pray
that every time I open my mouth I’ll be able to make Christ plain as day to them. Use your heads as you
live and work among outsiders. Don’t miss a trick. Make the most of every opportunity. Be gracious in your
speech. The goal is to bring out the best in others in a conversation, not put them down, not cut them out.
(The Message)
Mark 13:9 When these things begin to happen, watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and
beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But
this will be your opportunity to tell them about me. (NLT)
Luke 4:13 When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.
James 1:2 Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy.
(NLT)
Lord, forgive me for all the times I failed to take advantage of the opportunities presented to me. Open my
eyes that I might see the opportunities all around me. And give me the courage and boldness needed to not
only see but seize every God given opportunity. Amen
Now go in peace and may you enjoy a blessed weekend. Be sure to check out other ”o” related topics in the

I too often sit back and think of all the different opportunities that I let sip by and it sometimes saddens me. I get sad

don’t always see what’s there, but I’m a work in progress.
This was a really good post. Thank You...

You have spoken for me. I am poorer now because I did not take advantage of so many, many opportunities when I

@ModernDayDrifter, we all have missed some; just have to make the most of the present.

## Essential Ps in the Race of Life (2010-04-19 20:25)

[1]
Today the A-Z challenge continues and the letter of the day is P. As I pondered on various p-topics, two words
were plastered in the forefront of mind-patience and perseverance. Unlike you perhaps, I dont always like
the sound of the word of patience. It conjures up ideas of extended periods of waiting, waiting, and waiting.
Rather its waiting in line, being delayed by a slow driver in traffic, or sitting idly in the doctors office, I
dont always exhibit much patience. I become antsy, anxious, and complain because its seems like such a
waste of time not being able to progress at faster speeds. Merriam Websters dictionary defines patience
as the capacity, habit, or fact of being patient. Patient is defined as bearing pains or trials calmly with-
out complaint; not hasty; manifesting forbearance under provocation or strain; steadfast despite opposition,
difficulty, or adversity. In some cases, the only choice we have other than waiting is forgoing the item or
experience. Patience has to do with my attitude during the wait. And did you know that God is concerned
about how we wait in life? The Word of God is filled with promises but they dont appear overnight; theres a
time to wait on the fulfillment of the promise. Because He is God we cant control the timing of the promises
arrival; so waiting is inevitable but our attitude during this period is pretty important.
In my reading, I came across Colossians 1:10-12 which states, And we pray this in order that you may live a
life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the
knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have
great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the
inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. (NIV) I like to compare various translations of scripture and
really like the Amplified version of verse 11- [We pray] that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all
power according to the might of His glory, [to exercise] every kind of endurance and patience (perseverance
and forbearance) with joy. The Message gives another look at Colossians 1:9-10 Be assured that from the
first day we heard of you, we haven’t stopped praying for you, asking God to give you wise minds and spirits
attuned to his will, and so acquire a thorough understanding of the ways in which God works. We pray that
you’ll live well for the Master, making him proud of you as you work hard in his orchard. As you learn more
and more how God works, you will learn how to do your work. We pray that you’ll have the strength to stick
it out over the long haulnot the grim strength of gritting your teeth but the glory-strength God gives. It
is strength that endures the unendurable and spills over into joy, thanking the Father who makes us strong
enough to take part in everything bright and beautiful that he has for us.
These passages of scripture speak volumes to me today. If Im to have any increase in fruitfulness, produc-
tivity, or knowledge of God in my life, patience and perseverance are going to be essential. To accomplish

any goal, like weight loss for example, one must persist in a particular state or undertaking in spite of coun-
terinfluences, opposition or discouragement. And God knows that I have failed to complete some things I
started in life. Some things I started out strong but quickly became discouraged or too impatient to see
the end results. Looking at the passage, I see two other important Ps to incorporate in my life-prayer and
power. My human power alone will only get me so far but being infused with His power gives me the ability
to wait patiently and persevere. And prayer helps to tap into the greater power.

Wanda, the proof is in the pressing. Endure to the end in His unfailing love. – ”Have you never heard? Have you
never understood? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of all the earth. He never grows weak or weary.
No one can measure the depths of his understanding. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the
weak.” -Isaiah 40:28-29

Wanda, It sure is hard to be patient in losing weight.
I want it to fall off of me instantly. But it’s taking it’s own sweet time. It’s hard when you don’t see the fruit of the
choices you are making...
```

```
It’s hard in waiting on God as well. So often I want to see some evidence that something is happening, but so often
I don’t get to see that. It’s when the perseverance kicks into gear... I must continue on even when I can’t see things
happening.
Thanks for your visit to my blog and your sweet words. I’ve been out of pocket for these last few days as my daughter
miscarried last week. I’ve appreciated your visits to my blog and your sweet words.

Hi, I once heard that if one prays for patience, then God is going to send us situations that will test our patience,
because that is how we build it up. I don’t know if that is true or not, but it could be. I know I am certainly learning
it with a husband who has dementia.

## Quiet Please (2010-04-20 10:30)

Life can be quite noisy at times. Were inundated with music, television, family and friends to occupy our
time. Even things that we dont consider to be loud carry a sound. When I shut down my office computer,
Im amazed at how quiet the room suddenly sounds. Although Ive sat in there for hours, I had been oblivious
to the amount of white noise that was filling my space.
Likewise our inner selves can be full of white noise. Noisy expectations, frightening fears, negative self talk,
constant worries speak loudly in our souls. At times it is necessary to pull away from all the hustle and
bustle and just quieten ourselves. Frequently it is easier to live with the rumblings in our head than to be
still and wait on God. Take some quiet time to rest from all your toiling.
A few scriptures to meditate on:
Zephaniah 3:17 The LORD your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he
will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing.” (NIV)
Mark 6:31 Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to
eat, he said to them, ”Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.” Psalm 131:2 (English
Standard Version)
Psalm 131:2 But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child
is my soul within me. (NIV)

Wanda (2010-04-20 12:04:16)
Thanks Mike hope you find time to enjoy a little bit of quiet today.
Yvonne, you’re right we’re all different. I find that music or listening to water soothes my inner being as well.
Rae-great minds think a like I guess, I’ll be sure to take a look at your take on ”quiet” after work.
Hope you all have a blessed day. And may your souls be quiet even if there’s noise all around you.

Amen, Wanda. One of my favorite things to do is to walk down to the lake just before sunrise. No cars, gadgets ...
nothing but being still and silent. Always refreshes and restores.
Peace and love,

Linda (2010-04-20 18:40:35)
I especially love the scripture that says He will quiet you. Some of my favorite - and very rare - days are those when
I am home alone and nothing is on - no radio, no TV, quiet. Love it.

Robin (2010-04-20 19:08:07)
So true! I found myself blogging this message too this past week. Love your blog! Robin

I like your take on the different kinds of white noise – hadn’t thought about it like that before but you are right.
Sometimes some real quiet is necessary to allow the power of the Holy Spirit to move through us.

Patience and quiet really do go hand in hand. I tell my oldest all the time that we should be happy to wait, because
if we are waiting we are alive and life is a gift.

Lisa (2010-04-20 21:43:46)
Goodness, yes! This seems to be a running theme in blogland today - staying quiet and listening to God. I feel like
He’s been telling me to do that for a while now. I’m listening Lord!
Thank Wanda for visiting my blog and commenting too. You’re kindness is always appreciated!

Lorena G. Sims (2010-04-20 22:05:11)
Thanks for the scriptures. I had a lot of quiet time lately but not spending it with the Lord. Thanks for the post, it’s
good reminder for me that I need to spend quiet time with my God and not with the earthly things.

Ellie (2010-04-20 22:26:02)
Thanks for the gentle reminder; This is a wonderful post! We do need quiet time for reflection and prayer!

Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-04-20 23:44:41)
hi Wanda!:)
love the Zeph. 3:17 one of my favorites. i need some time out with Him, definitely!
it’s a busy time now for me and i apologize for getting here late...lately!
agree with Ellie. thank you for the reminder!

Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-04-20 23:45:11)
need some praise music!!!

Grammy (2010-04-21 01:43:02)
You ere right about noise, we always have either the radio or television on most of the time. However, sometimes we
do sit on our front porch and just enjoy the beauty of nature all around us. Ir does us good to just sit and soak up
the sounds of birds.
Ruby

Dragons Muse (2010-04-21 04:54:10)
Yes so true, I often have to remind myself to take time out and be quiet, listen for God’s message.

Lisa-Heed His voice :)
Lorena & Ellie-you’re welcome & thanks to you
Bud-I just recently came across that scripture and I just love it. I understand about being busy. I’m having a hard
time keeping up these days.
Grammy-yes it certainly does.

Trudy (2010-04-27 05:50:20)
A beautiful ’Q’ post...I’m a bit late catching up on blogs here. It is so easy to get away from the quietness of life
without realizing it, but I know when I haven’t had my quiet time with the Lord, I can feel it after a few days!
Love the Scripture you have chosen to accompany your post too!

## Re (2010-04-21 13:20)

[1]
Re is a prefix meaning again or anew. One of the first re(s) to come to mind is reruns. I dont know about
you but Im not very fond of watching television reruns, although certain channels in my satellite package are
racked full of them. On the occasion that I forget to set the DVR, I can appreciate the encore presentation of

my favorite shows. For some shows, it looks like certain episodes are repeated more than others. Kind of like
how certain life events keep making reoccurrences in our lives. Sure the characters, dates, and times might
be different but the underlying issue is repeated. Like the guy or gals name is different but the relationship
ends up the same as all the others. The job is new but the results are same. Your location changes but
the same problems follow you. Could it be that in the midst of the repetition God is giving us another
opportunity to catch the lesson we missed before?
Retaking a life test is not always fun but Im grateful for some do overs in my life. Christ coming offers me
REDEMPTION. When Im empty He REPLENISHES me. Even when it looks like Im on the losing in end,
He promises to RESTORE. In my brokenness, He REPAIRS the breaches. He even offers a REWARD. As
discouragement and feelings of giving up begin to overtake me, He will send along a word to REVIVE me.

Thank you Lord for the things youre doing anew and again in my life. Its only because of your loving
kindness that Im not without hope or utterly consumed. May He continuously redeem, replenish, restore,
repair, revive and reward you in any and every place that you stand in need today. You’ve done it before,
oh God, now do it again I pray. In Jesus Name Amen

Now review some other interesting ”R” related post from other [2]A-Z Challengers.

## Satisfaction Guaranteed (2010-04-22 22:02)

Rather late getting my post up today. My mind was not settled on what ”s” topic I wanted to discuss last
night and didn’t have time to gather my thoughts before heading to work this morning. Ok, so on with my
post.
You ever notice that on the back of many products there’s a promise of satisfaction? On the back of my
Suave lotion in small fine print it reads: We guarantee your full satisfaction or we will replace or refund
your purchase. Now I like the lotion and have had no problems with it. But, I have acquired some other
things in life that I was certain would bring me satisfaction. I obtained positions, car and house-the supposed
American dream. Yet some how it didn’t seem enough. I found myself becoming disillusion and discontent
after the newness wore off.
Marketing in today’s society aims to capitalize on our insatiable desire for more, more, more. Right when
you think you have the latest and greatest something more improved comes along. I would not consider
myself to be materialistic so my dis-ease was not because I was seeking more things. Just that the place I
was in did not fit. I simply was not satisfied and questioned within myself that surely there was more to life.
In Philippians 4:12-13, Paul states (my paraphrase) he has learned the secret to being content despite
whatever situation he found himself. I remember a while back a book titled The Secret was all the rage.
Oprah had the author on her show. Maybe it’s human nature to seek out those secrets that tend to allude
us at times. Here we find Paul saying he finally figured it out that it’s through Christ that true contentment
comes. He didn’t give any false guarantees that the happenings in life would always be favorable. But in
spite of it, one could still be content. I found that passage to be challenging. How can I be satisfied when I
don’t like what is occurring around me? Honestly, I haven’t mastered the art of contentment. But in reading
something the other day, I gained greater insight on contentment. When I know and trust that where I am
is not outside of God’s radar, I can be confident that He is orchestrating all things and that there is indeed
a plan for my life. Therefore, I can patiently wait on Him.
Of course possessions alone can never bring true satisfaction. It’s only found in Christ and our relationship
with Him is one place we shouldn’t settle. There is always more of Him to know and experience. I have
provided link to a beautiful worship song by William McDowell entitled Show Me Your Face.
[EMBED]
Until ”T” time tomorrow, I hope enjoy a wonderful evening.

Lisa (2010-04-23 01:53:32)
What you wrote about today is something I am continuing to learn. I don’t have a job and no income at all (denied
for unemployment because I quit), but God is showing me that HE is ALL I need. Now and forever. It’s not an easy
lesson to learn, but I am learning. My Jesus NEVER ceases to amaze me. I’m glad I’m His. :O)
This song is beautiful. ”Show me Your Face, I want to see You” that is indeed my heart’s cry!
Praise Him!!

Apart from the bible the best book on satisfaction or contentment that you will ever read is a book called The Rare
Jewel of Christian Contentment by Jeremiah Burroughs.
It is published by The Banner of Truth Trust - it is a must read for every believer!
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-04-23 16:27:16)
Amen! Amen! The one place we should never settle is in our zeal for more of God. Oh, how I love Jesus (I’m humming
that little Sunday school song).
Have a blessed day!
```

```
Linda (2010-04-23 17:14:29)
Your posts never fail to stimulate thought. The idea of satisfaction - being satisfied where we are - but most of all
with Jesus.

## Quench Your Thirst (2010-04-23 17:57)

[1]

On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and said in loud voice, If anyone is thirsty, let him
come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow
from within. John 7:37-38
In this particular passage of scripture Christ issues an invitation to anyone whose thirsty [that would include
me] to come and drink from Him and that if you would believe, from within you would flow streams of living
water. In the natural when we thirst we look for something outside of ourselves to quench our thirst. Water
can satisfy the thirst but each individual has his own preference of drink [for me, coke]. Because I don’t settle
for the most basic thirst quencher ”water”, there has been numerous additives and weight added physically.
Water in it’s pure state has nothing added and has zero calories. Other synthetic thirst quenchers are man

made attempts to satiate our thirst sensation but each comes along with unnecessary additives.
Spiritually speaking, Christ, is the purest thirst quencher that is available within us but many times we seek
to fill the dry place with other external things like relationships, eating, shopping, alcohol, drugs, careers, or
possessions. These other sources’ thirst quenching abilities are only temporary and they bring along additives
like addictions, perversions, debt, stress, or soulish weights that continue to cause us to be parched again.
Thus, initiating the thirst cycle repeatedly.
Is your soul parched? The invitation to come drink still stands.
Now teeter on over and see what other A-Z Challengers are discussing [2]here.

```

```
Chris Weigand (2010-04-23 19:19:56)
Great post. It’s amazing when the most perfect quencher is out there and attainable how we always reach for the
things that will only quench for a short time if at all. What is even more amazing is that Jesus continues to wait for
us long past the time when we would have given up.
```

```
Beth (2010-04-23 20:13:58)
Perfect Q Post! :) Guilty of some times trying to quench those thirsts with other things. Silly! Cause I know that
NOTHING satisfies like Jesus!
```

```
Gregg (2010-04-23 22:36:58)
John 4 & John 7 tells us Christ is the living water. How sad and tragic that we don’t believe him, that we run back to
the leeks, garlics, and onions like the Israelites did. May God’s grace continualy call us to drink deeply of the living
water!

arlee bird (2010-04-23 23:40:24)
Jesus used a great metaphor in referring to ”Living Water” and ”quenching our thirst”. We should accept no substi-

Oh good tie in between substitutes for water and substitutes for Jesus. There is no substitute for Him.

Grammy (2010-04-24 01:20:33)
Yes, He is the Living Water. Did you know that our tissues are 75 percent water? How apropos that He used that
simile to describe Himself. When one is thirsty, nothing can be substituted for a drink of water. We have well water,
and it is wonderful too. Thanks for the wonderful post.
Ruby

melodygreen (2010-04-24 01:42:27)
This reminds me that... though I often say I don’t prefer water, when I start drinking it more I crave it more. The
same is true for Bible study and Christ. I really love this post!!

Bud, ditto for me.
Chris, thank goodness that He does wait.

## Until When? (2010-04-24 19:31)

U is the letter of the day in the A-Z challenge. My word I chose for today is until. I remember when I
was a kid in school I couldnt wait until I was grown and able to make decisions on my own. After reaching
adulthood, I realize those carefree years werent so bad after all. How many times have you put something
off until a more favorable time? Or you failed to enjoy your present because you were focused on a time in
the future?
As singles were often tempted to put off enjoying life until our mate comes alone. Waiting to buy homes,
cars, investments, or take trips. Those of us who struggle with our weight will put off engaging in certain
activities until reaching our ideal size. We can delay getting involved in opportunities to serve others.
Waiting to share a smile, give kind word, or make a difference in someones life until we have gotten
ourselves together. Waiting to step out until were absolutely certain its the best time. Choosing to use
the good china until company comes. Refusing to take a moment for yourself until everyone else needs
are met. Not trusting until we see evidence.
There are all sorts of reasons (or excuses) we give for not moving on or making the most of our lives. Like I
cant forgive until they apologize. The myriad of excuses is unbelievable. Im not proposing that we take
on foolish risk or get ahead of God. But that we take some time to observe what weve been putting on
hold until. As I wrote in a previous post, I journal sometime and one day I was reading over some of the
whispers from God. There was a statement that said youre ready now. More ready than youve ever been.
Within your own self, you will never feel ready. I once read a quote that said something like you have to do
a thing first and then your feelings will follow. Theres some truth in that statement because I sure didnt
feel like getting on my treadmill this morning but I feel better now that I did. So again, I encourage you
to examine the untils in your life and decide or discover the ones that you can begin making steps toward
today.
Ecclesiastes 11:4 Those who wait for perfect weather will never plant seeds; those who look at every cloud
will never harvest crops.
On another note, a few months ago, I knew very little about blogging. Even now that knowledge is limited.
But until I started, I never knew how much it would help me to give voice to the ramblings in my head.
Until I dared to leap into the A-Z Challenge, I never knew so many of you. And its unlikely that our paths
would have crossed. But Im thankful for the opportunity to have been in union with you. Until next time,
I hope you enjoy a wonderful weekend.

arlee bird (2010-04-25 05:02:23)
Wonderful post that is very appropriate to what we’ve been doing.
As is sometimes said: ”There’s no time like the present.”
The waiting can even be good if you take advantage of the opportunities it presents. No sense wishing one’s life away
– enjoy it now!
Glad you got so much out of A to Z (I did too!). Hope you will post some more of your thoughts on May 3rd.

Thanks for sharing and for brightening my day!

## You’re the Vessel (2010-04-26 14:11)

[1]

The A-Z challenge continues with the letter V. My focus word for the day is vessel. Vessel is defined as a
hollow or concave utensil for holding anything or a ship or boat. Just as ships carry goods, we as humans
are carriers as well. Now, I really don’t know a lot about ships but I do understand that they operate in the
water. And I would imagine that on occasion these vessels run into some storms at sea while attempting to
transport their goods to the appropriate port. Not unlike ourselves, we become battered by life storms or
events such as childhood, work, relationship, or health issues. The storms are designed to delay or detour
us from reaching our divine destination and ultimately destroy us, if possible. But why? Because you’re
carrying something valuable. No matter how the vessel has been damaged or looks on the outside, its real
treasure is found inside. Every human has been created with purpose. And what you’re holding someone
else needs.
Our inner enemy would often have us believe that based upon the look of the vessel-damaged, broken, and
bruised parts-that we couldn’t possibly posses anything of significance to someone else. In our eyes, we may

appear as just a small boat in a vast ocean full of larger more pristine looking ships. Yet if you’re sailing
along in this life, there’s a void that only you can fill. Our individual voyages differ and the size and shape
of our vessels are not the same but the fact remains that your cargo is full of treasure.
However, we possess this precious treasure [the divine Light of the Gospel] in [frail, human] vessels of earth,
that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves.
2 Corinthians 4:7 (Amplified)
If you only look at us, you might well miss the brightness. We carry this precious Message around in the
unadorned clay pots of our ordinary lives. That’s to prevent anyone from confusing God’s incomparable
power with us. 2 Corinthians 4:7 (The Message)
If you have a minute, take some time to listen to The Corinthian Song by Micah Stampley.

Very encouraging post and filled with truth! I especially love this sentence, ”Our individual voyages differ and the
size and shape of our vessels are not the same but the fact remains that your cargo is full of treasure.” I also love the
song!!!
```

```
Lisa (2010-04-26 17:05:34)
”I’m a vessel full of power, with a treasure from the Lord.” AMEN! I’m so glad to be a vessel that is being steered by
the Creator of the Universe! Beautiful song!!

Andrea (2010-04-26 18:37:21)
AMEN!

Linda (2010-04-26 22:38:47)
Always love your posts. Thinking about the ships and life’s storms I was reminded of the song ”In Times Like These”
- some of the words talk about being sure our anchor holds and grips the solid rock: Jesus.
```

```
Gregg (2010-04-26 23:07:00)
That treasure is Christ. There is nothing within us that warrants being called or considered treasure. He chose to
place Himself, as the greatest gift to be treasured in this earthen vessle in order for us to reflect His glorious character
to this world so that they too might desire this treasure!
```

```
Wanda (2010-04-27 01:00:15)
Faith Imagined & Lisa, glad you enjoyed the song.
Whom we allow to steer our lives is very important.
Andrea, blessings to you.
Linda, no greater anchor than Christ.
Gregg, certainly Christ is the ultimate treasure. Yet He created each us to fulfill a purpose in this life, which makes
us significant.

melodygreen (2010-04-27 04:31:02)
I really liked this post! It is so easy to let storms of life beat us down and forget that we carry precious cargo – thanks
for posting this reminder!

```
Trudy (2010-04-27 05:34:08)
I LOVE this post Wanda! Such a fabulous analogy between the ship as a vessel and our own lives as vessels! Praise
Him!
Have a blessed day!

## Never Walk Alone (2010-04-27 11:02)

It’s something about walking in the morning that clears my head and helps to get my day off to a great start.
As I walk, I hear the gentle whispers of instructions or inspirations. Often it’s then is when the answers
to things I’ve longed pondered seem to be revealed to me. But there are just as many other times that I
don’t sense any overwhelming presence of Him. But as I gaze at the sky or listen to melody of the birds
sing, I see His handiwork. I’m awfully grateful that even when I can’t sense Him and I can’t hear His voice
because of the noise in my head, He never leaves me to walk alone. He’s always watching and knows my
exact whereabouts even when I’m lost.
Isaiah 43:2 When you go through deep waters,I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty,
you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames
will not consume you.

Just Be Real (2010-04-27 11:08:31)
Amen Wanda. I love my early morning walks as well. On those walks I get a lot of inspiration that I know is only
from the Lord. Thank you for sharing dear one. Blessings.

That’s one of my favorite part of having a dog, daily excuse to go for a walk! Well-said, have a great day!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-04-27 14:18:43)
Hallelujah! Getting out in the morning is a great reminder of His presence. I always think of His grace in those
moments.
Blessed beyond,

Shannon (2010-04-27 16:22:40)
I love to walk with the Lord in the morning, but sadly have not been able to as of late due to being ill! I enjoyed this
very much!
```

arlee bird (2010-04-27 17:34:27)
I’ve been doing the morning walks and think of those things like you say as I look at the trees, plants, and flowers.
Of course, where I am I also have to watch out for the traffic and walk past a lot of businesses and houses. But I’m
still thanking and praising God for letting me have such a blessed life.

Patricia Stoltey (2010-04-28 04:11:05)
There is something about being alone outside in the early morning that reaches all of us. When I lived in Florida, it
was the ocean in the early morning. Now in Colorado it’s the hiking trails. It’s a good feeling.

## Random Things about Me (2010-04-28 00:37)

[1]

It’s time for the Single, Sassy Blogger link up for April at [2]Exemplify Online Singles. This month we’re
asked to share seven random things about ourselves. So here goes my list:

1. The first car I bought was purple Pontiac Sunfire.

2. I happen to be afraid of anything that creeps and/or crawls.
3. I’m a recovering perfectionist.
4. I absolutely love books and I can speed hours browsing in a bookstore. Speaking of books, my new favorite
thing is swapping books via paperbackswap.
5. I love Tex-Mex food.
6. My favorite Bath & Body scent is Moonlight Path. Nothing like a nice bubble bath :)
7. Never thought I’d own a dog but I’ve been sharing my place with Bella, my furbaby I adopted from a
shelter, for almost two years now.
Well that’s a pretty random view of me. Find other single, sassy bloggers and join the fun [3]here.

Furry babies are fabulous. They help when you are lonely. Tex-mex yum. I want to go to Texas and try some
authentic goodness.
A purple car? LOVE it. And my fave from B &BW is Butterfly Flower....I use to love Gardenia but sadly they took
it away.
And books? Girl. Don’t get me started ;)
Thank for joining us today Wanda! I love learning more about you beautiful ladies.

Alyssa Rose (2010-04-28 01:15:06)
Thanks for stopping by, Wanda! That is so cool that you had a Pontiac as your first car! I did, too! But mine was a
Grandam and a pain to fix!
My favorite B &B Works scent is Enchanted Orchid but they discontinued it. So, now I am starting to fall for Twilight
Woods!
Hope you are having a fabulous day!

## X Marks the Spot (2010-04-28 15:10)

[1]

Well we’re back to our regularly scheduled A-Z Challenge post and today’s letter is ”X”. Now I must admit
that I had to sneak a peak in the dictionary for some ideas since I don’t regularly use words beginning with
that letter. However, none stuck out to me as much as the plain old letter ”x”. I often x things off my to-do
list or mark an x when filling out forms. But did you know that even in today’s time, some people are
unable to write their name and have to sign forms with an ”x”? Reading and writing are fundamental things
that I often take for granted. Yet, many of my ancestors labored to ensure those behind them would have
the opportunity to read and write. According to the Department of Justice statistics, 21 million Americans
can’t read at all, 45 million are marginally illiterate and one-fifth of high school graduates can’t read their
diplomas.

However, in my line of work, I see people using ”x” as their signature not because they’re unable to read but
because they’re physically disabled due to some type of medical condition or motor vehicle accident. I can’t
imagine the daily struggle to perform even the simplest of task. Today as I go about reading posts, typing
and adding my signature to copious notes, I do it with conscious gratitude for not just the knowledge to read
and write but for the ability to use my hands.
As this month long A to Z challenge quickly comes to an end, it will soon be one of the tasks I can mark x
through as completed. Many of the participants will be joining a mega post on May 3 to discuss what weve

learned through this event. In the mean time find out what other x-rated (oops I meant related) topics are
being expounded today [2]here.

Hard to believe we are near the end; it went by quickly! Phew, the dreaded X is over!

Wanda (2010-04-29 03:28:19)

New design on the blog? Love it! And great X post. I had to do a little dictionary reading also, then decided to go
with the only X word I could think of. Another A-Z challenge? I don’t know...
```

```
Watery Tart (2010-04-29 13:17:16)
What a great reminder to be thankful for what we have–healthy enough limbs to write AND literacy. It is so foreign
to think about a day when people couldn’t do that (or had to carry about a stamp to mark themselves because so few
read and write) but we forget that there are people today with huge challenges. I think if I lost my ability to write,
my sanity would soon follow right behind.
```

```
Tori Cooper (2010-04-29 22:56:30)
Funny how our posts correlate... :-) I wrote about XO’s- Hugs & Kisses... how legend has it that people used an X to
sign their name & then they would kiss it to finalize everything...I had no idea people still signed with X’s! COOL!
```

## Y is for Yield (2010-04-29 20:31)

Hi y’all (in my southern drawl). Hard to believe that we’re already at the letter ”Y”. Today Y is for yield.
I remember when I was kid in church there was a song we used to sing that lyrics said, ”young people yield
yourself to God, while you’re young and in your youth, yield yourself to God”. Hadn’t heard that song in
years. The songwriter understood that the younger we are the less opportunity we have had to build up a
resistance toward God.
When I think of the word yield, the yield traffic sign comes to mind. The yield sign is a place where I
have to pause momentarily and possibly give another driver the right of way. Makes me wonder about the
things we often give the right away in our lives. As a Christian, God is the person we are suppose to submit
ourselves unto but there are times when I find myself fighting not to succumb to frustration, disappointment,
fear, offense, depression, or doubt. Of course, it’s important to pause a moment to acknowledge our feelings
because denial does one little good. But giving those negative feelings free reign in our lives yields bad fruit.
There are times when it seems easier to hold onto those feelings rather than saying yes, I choose to let that
go. For the past couple of days, after receiving some unexpected news, I’ve found myself feeling grieved and
confused. But I’ve been hearing the words, let not your heart be troubled. It’s up to me to choose what I’ll
give the right away to-my feelings or God’s Word.
Isaiah 55:10-11 10 As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering
the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is
my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire
and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
Romans 6:13 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves
unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto
God.
Are you yielding to the right things in your life? Have you given the Master a yes? [EMBED]

Linda (2010-04-29 22:46:22)
Oh you did good. Yield is a great Y word, especially the way you explain it. I am sorry to hear that something is
bothering you and I hope that won’t last.
```

```
Lisa (2010-04-29 22:48:57)
I will say YES! Great song and great post. I have issues with yielding those same things that you mentioned. I want
to ALWAYS give God the right-of-way in my life – YIELD to Him! :)
```

```
Tori Cooper (2010-04-29 22:52:44)
Love it! God is good! Thank you for sharing this... and the verses too! :-) Yield to the LORD! Connects well with
what I posted today... :-D
```

```
Ellie (2010-04-30 02:33:37)
I agree great word, you did it proud!
It makes me think, I have had moments that were easy to yield and
some that were not! Powerful, as always
```

```
Grammy (2010-04-30 03:25:26)
Hi,
Another great Christian song is ”Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin”. It has long been one of my favorites.
Good post for Y.
Ruby
```

```
Rae (2010-04-30 10:43:14)
I hope your worries are lessened with each day. Thinking of you and my need to yield...Thanks!
```

```
Wanda (2010-04-30 18:34:55)
Thanks to each of you for stopping by. Linda & Rae, I appreciate your concern.
```

```
CeCe Wilson (2010-05-01 01:23:21)
Thanks for your insightful and thoughtful posts. Always a good word when I need it. Yield. Let go of the right away
and let God. I like it :0)

## Z is for (2010-04-30 13:34)

Z is Zenith TV.

We had a floor model TV for years. I thought it was a Zenith but Mom said ours was a Magnavox.

[1]

Z is for Zoo

Lisa over at [2]Bombastic Bandicot posted a cute pic from the [3]Ft. Worth Zoo the other day. So I
decided to post a similar snapshot I captured from my visit.

[4]
I’ll probably be zipping back to write a more thorough Z-post for the end of the A-Z Challenge, when I get
some extra time. But in the mean time, zap over to [5]Tossing It Out find out what others are talking about.

She is in heaven now. I hope there’s a Zenith up there!

## 1.3 May

## Z is for Zachariah (2010-05-01 03:54)

Well before getting some zzz’s for the night, I thought I’d actually write a post to finalize the A-Z Challenge.
On this round, Z is for Zachariah, who was married to Elizabeth. There story is found in Luke 1. As I read
through this particular chapter, a few things stood out to me.
Zachariah and Elizabeth were described as being righteous and walking blameless before the Lord. Yet
they found themselves lacking something in their lives that they had dearly wanted. On an ordinary day
as Zachariah was serving in the house of God, he had a divine visitation bringing news that not only had
his prayers been heard but now would be answered. Yet Zachariah was fearful and in doubt. Which tells
me that you can be serving in ministry in the house of God, the place where God is suppose to be, but be
surprise when He actually shows up. Could it be that we’re often going through the motion of things without
real expectation of God making an appearance in our personal lives?
The angel was bringing him the answer to their prayers, which quite possibly had long been forgotten since
their condition (Elizabeth’s barrenness) had remained the same. And their position in regards to age had
changed for the worse. However, the fact that the angel showed up with news that their request was to be
answered tells me that at some point they had been praying the will of God. But the proper time and season

had to coincide with one another. God had a greater purpose for Zachariah and Elizabeth having a baby
than just reducing her shame or keeping up with the Jones. John needed to come on the scene at a certain
time.
I also noted that Zachariah was made mute because he didn’t believe the angel’s message. But after the
baby was born and he named the baby as the angel had instructed, he was able to talk again. Which leads
me to believe that there are times when we should be quiet until we bring our speech into alignment with
God’s Word. I wonder what was going on in Elizabeth’s mind when her husband came home speechless.
Their story makes me want to reexamine the things I once prayed for but have silently relinquished by stance
because after all that area in my life is still bare and I have only increased in age. I find myself looking to
see if there’s some topics I need to refrain from discussing until I can get the mind of Christ on the matter.
As I reflect on their story, it has me calling out to God asking Him to raise my expectation and help my
unbelief.
Watch for the May 3 A-Z Mega post. Until then hope y’all have a great weekend.

What a great reminder of how we need to be open to the things God has for us, even if we think it’s past the time we
thought it would come. :)

## Reflections on the A to Z Challenge (2010-05-03 16:51)

As with any endeavor you undertake, I found a sense of personal satisfaction in not just starting but com-
pleting the A-Z challenge. Ecclesiastes 7:8a states, something completed is better than something begun
(CEV). And better I am. I decided to join the challenge on a whim after reading about it on [1]Shannons
blog. As a newbie blogger (just started in February), Im not exactly sure what gave me the audacity to
launch out into such deep waters. But, I have found myself being open to lots of new things in this year and
blogging itself is one of those.

Being a part of the challenge increased my awareness of the variety of blogs available. It was quite interesting
to visit other participants blogs to see how they would incorporate the letter of the day in their post. Many
of the challengers were either professional writers or aspiring to be; therefore, splashing around at their
blogs was like being a pet goldfish dumped into the ocean. Also, I discovered poets, photographers, artists,
mommy bloggers, spiritual blogs, teachers and even a [2]Blabbin Grammy, who is a master storyteller. The
gamut of blogs is amazing. Many I would not have found otherwise. Each time I visited one, I was exposed
to new ideas, concepts, words and inspiration.

Prior to starting the challenge, I wrote down topic ideas for each letter on the calendar but I found that
I didnt always go with my initial thought. For some letters, I was able to get my posts completed early,
edited and scheduled to post (which is a feature I discovered). However, the inspiration for the majority of
posts came the same day, which added stress initially until I came to terms that it was ok if my posts were
not perfect but authentically reflected me. I found blogging, visiting other participants, commenting and
replying to comments daily to be challenging along with working full-time. And I sure have a respect for
those who are able to post daily or multiple times during the day. However, that is not something I plan to
continue but I do see the importance of maintaining a regular posting schedule.

I dont believe I ever considered quitting but sometimes wondered if I could keep up. The things that kept
me going were the determination not to be a quitter and the lovely comments I would receive from those that
stopped by. To all of you who came by, I say THANK YOU! And a special thanks to those that dropped
in consistently and left me such encouraging words. Youll never know how much of a boost of confidence

and courage youve been to me. In accordance with Proverbs 11:25, I pray that just as you have refreshed
me during this challenge, that you will be refreshed. Thanks to Rayna at [3]Coffee Rings Everywhere who
gave me my very first blog award and I will be passing it forward soon. As a newbie, I didnt know awards
existed. Also, thanks to Charmaine over at [4]Wagging Tales who bestowed three awards to me. Id like to
take this opportunity to pass on the Sunshine Award to a few people who have been a great support to me:
Lisa @ [5]Bombastic Bandicoot, Bluebutterfly@ [6]Sword of Goliath, Ellie @ [7]Ellas Edge, Andrea @[8]Arise
2 Write, Rae@ [9]Porch Ponderings by Rae, Bud@ [10]B-E-ing Transformed, Linda@[11]Whits End, CeCe@
[12]Thirsty Living and my sister, LaMecia, who always gives me words of encouragement.

[13]

Overall Im satisfied with my performance in the challenge. As with most things we do, there is room for
improvement on my part. I wish that I had more time to dedicate to researching, writing, and editing my
posts. While I tried to visit as many of the challenge participants as possible, I would have liked more time
to read and comment on their posts. And I found that I gravitated to some blogs more because I found
their subject matter more in line with my interests. Since my blog deals with spiritual matters, Im sure
some participants were less likely to visit. I did see an increase in the number of followers but I think itll be
interesting to see how many continue to follow and/or comment from time to time. From the experience I
learned that networking among bloggers is a good means for increasing exposure of your blog and for finding
other blogs you like. However, I tend to shy away from the follow me and I will follow you theory. After
seeing how beneficial a comment was to me, I plan to be more disciplined about leaving comments on the
blogs I read. I liked Arlees idea of having a schedule for specific blog topics.
In closing Id like to give our challenge host, Arlee at [14]Tossing it Out, a big round of applause for a job
well done in organizing and marketing a successful challenge that was able to unite so many bloggers across
the globe. He seems to have mastered the art of blogging and blog promotion. I wish him much success in
his future endeavors and look forward to reading more from him. If you have not already, be sure to visit his
blog. I appreciate the opportunity to have joined the challenge with so many talented and creative bloggers.

hi Wanda! i have to say that this challenge was a bit overwelming even for me. i really appreciate yours and the
other’s dedication to our Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. it makes/made a difference in my life having brothers and
sisters standing alongside me. i loved reading your posts that always reflected Him in your life. ”we” have a long ways
to go together, sister:) congratulations and thank you for the award as well!
```

```
Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-05-03 17:43:54)
btw Wanda, i can certainly understand why you received the comment award!!! you have commented on all of my
posts, i think. if not all, then certainly the majority of them. it really surprised me to get your award and Tori’s.
when all this hoopla dies down after today, i’m surely going to pass them along:)

Kierah Jane Reilly (2010-05-03 18:00:14)

Just blogging since February? No way.. .you are too good! I love your insights, your thoughts - and I will keep
reading what you have to say. And as soon as I can figure out how to post the award, I will (have a lesson on blogging
lined up for Wednesday) and will pass it on! Thank you.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-05-03 22:16:49)
Congrats, Wanda, and thank you...you have refreshed me. In reading this post, I thought about a Scripture in my
favorite Book, Ecclesiastes: ”Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave,b there will be no work or
planning or knowledge or wisdom.
11I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesnt always win the race, and the strongest
warrior doesnt always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy.
And those who are educated dont always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place
at the right time.” Ecclesiastes 9:10-11
Be blessed beyond.

Elizabeth West (2010-05-04 01:35:04)
Thanks so much, Wanda, for your comments. I appreciate that you took the time to read my blog and I plan to return
to yours as well. :)

Hey! I hadn’t heard of the A-Z challenge before, but I have to say, I love it when people do something, unique, like
this and set out to take on the challenge, conquer, and appreciate what they have achieved! Its super awesome! And
- what a nice blog of ’Thanks!” you are a genuine soul and I really enjoyed reading your appreciation of others!
I popped over to say hi, from Australia, via the Sassy Single Bloggers link-up. Because, frankly, we simply just ROCK!
GBU!

Hope you have a Wonderful Wednesday
I like the look of your site!

```
Patricia Stoltey (2010-05-06 05:17:12)
I enjoyed the blog challenge so much, but honestly, Wanda, I still haven’t visited all the blogs on Arlee’s list. I’m
determined to get to all of them though.
One thing I’ve noticed is that some blogs are especially restful and comforting places to visit. Yours is like that. I’m
glad you’re here.

Hi Wanda, thanks for stopping by my little corner earlier on this Word-Filled Wednesday. I love this verse and the
picture so refreshes me. I wish I was right in that picture today as I am grieving the loss of our 10 year Golden
Retriever and almost didn’t participate this WFW. I’m glad I did because with every click I am simply refreshed with
His Word and I got to connect with you. I clicked on your google follow and look forward to more visits.
Love and blessings!

```

```
Ellie (2010-05-06 20:33:08)
I loved your answers, very admirable!
I love sun chips, I totally didn’t put any chips, but I do love them!
I use to watch Survivor, I want them to go to Alaska...or have Men have to function like women. Nails,
perms,manicures, pedicures, panty hose, rollers, perms...they can’t do the pregnancy thang. They could do the
high heels and see how long they survive!
```

```
Wanda (2010-05-06 21:29:30)
Bud, I didn’t get into the show at first but the past few seasons I’ve been hooked.
Ellie..lol, men functioning as woman would make a very interesting show.
```

```
Lisa (2010-05-10 18:32:31)
How did I miss this? I don’t know...I just haven’t seen any of your posts coming up in my reader.
Thank you for participating Wanda. I enjoyed reading your answers. You and I seem to have a lot in common. The
#1 thing being our love for Jesus Christ! :O)

## Imprisoned Thoughts (2010-05-07 03:58)

[1]

Stop! What are you thinking about at this exact moment? What thoughts have been swimming through
your mind lately? During the course of a day, many random thoughts flow through my head. At times Im
thinking about work, family, blogging, TV shows, Bible verses, or some spark of inspiration.
Being in church Ive heard 2 Corinthians 10:5 which states, Casting down imaginations and every high thing
that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ, quoted on several occasions and I have read it a few times. After reading Mark Battersons book
Primal a few months ago, that verse took on new meaning to me. He states, This verse is not just about
capturing sinful thoughts and keeping them out of our minds; its also about capturing creative thoughts
and keeping them in our minds. It means stewarding every word, every thought, every impression, and every
revelation inspired by the Spirit of God. Now this was a fresh perspective for me. Having been someone
immobilized by fears and irrational or negative thoughts, I understood the impact of failing to get a grip on
your thought life.
But I never considered the responsibility I had to be a good steward of those passing inspirations or God
thoughts. I cant tell you how many times an idea came to mind but I failed to hold it captive and it was
soon forgotten until something triggered the memory again. Of course, every idea that comes to mind is not
necessarily a God thought but I do wonder what could I do or be, if I did more to arrest those thoughts. If
I wasnt so quick to cast them away as being meaningless or impossible, there is no telling how different my
life might be.
Are your thoughts holding you captive to people, places, events or are you holding your thoughts as prisoners?
There is a world of difference between the two. Have you come across any quote or book that has changed
your perspective on a matter lately? If so, please share.

You know Wanda, this is very interesting. I too am so guilty of not being a better steward of my creative thoughts.
I know many times I see or hear things and I see a devotional or a poem coming out of it but I do nothing, it comes
back another time, I do nothing and it goes.
I too have never seen that coming from that familiar verse, but it is a fresh perspective.
Thx for dropping by my blog. You have a lovely home here.
Blessings,

Wow! Great things to meditate on. I know the thoughts that come into your mind. As a man thinketh in his
heart. All through the Bible are references to the thoughts and words of our heart.
We spend a lot of time thinking about the past and the future, often forgetting to appreciate the present, but Eccle-
siastes, one of my favorite Books, contains some Verses that are ever present with me, because they make me live in
balance:
Never make light of the king, even in your thoughts. And don’t make fun of the powerful, even in your own bedroom.
For a little bird might deliver your message and tell them what you said. - Ecclesiastes 10:20
In the day of prosperity be happy, but in the day of adversity considerGod has made the one as well as the other so
that man will not discover anything that will be after him. I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there
is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.
Do not be excessively righteous and do not be overly wise. Why should you ruin yourself? Do not be excessively
wicked and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? It is good that you grasp one thing and also not
let go of the other; for the one who fears God comes forth with both of them. - Ecclesiastes 7:14-18
Everything has already been decided. It was known long ago what each person would be. So theres no use arguing
with God about your destiny. - Ecclesiastes 6:10
The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every
person. For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil. - Ecclesiastes
12:13-14
```

Trudy (2010-05-07 20:59:25)
A very powerful verse indeed. So important to remember that it is a twofold process, getting rid of the old (sinful
thoughts) and replacing it with the new (creative thoughts).
Great post Wanda! God bless you!

## The Blahs (2010-05-11 12:38)

[1]
Blah, blah, blah.... I seem to have woke up with the case of the blahs this morning for no apparent reason.
There’s nothing out of ordinary that has occurred in my life. Perhaps it’s more of the ordinary that has
plunged me into this depth of the blues. I find myself asking the same question the Psalmist did, ”O my
soul why art thou disquieted within me?” Guess I should put the rest of the verse in practice and a change
of mood will come.
**Psalm 43:5** _Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me and be disquieted_
_within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the help of my_
_[sad] countenance, and my God.(Amplified Bible)_ Psalm 43:5 (The Message)
**Psalm 43:5** _Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on_
_God_ _soon I’ll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He’s my God._ (The Message)

Everybody has these down days. I sure do! Imagine what boring people we would be if we were happy all the time.
We would never have opinions, questions, or inspiration to learn new things if we were always happy. I think sadness
makes us better people. I’d cherish it now and again, if I were you. I do. I embrace it, feel it, then let it fly away. I
hope you feel better soon. xx

## Some Things Don’t Change (2010-05-12 06:30)

Life is full of changes-seasons change, businesses open and close, relationships that started out full of hope
end in divorce, children grow up, jobs are changed, laws change. Even with so many things seeming constant,
change is all around us. Just yesterday I was feeling blue but today I’m feeling like my old self again. As I
came across Isaiah 54:10 in my reading this week, I was grateful that amongst all the changes I encounter,
there are still some things that remain the same.

## Steps Along the Way (2010-05-14 20:30)

[1]

As I walked this morning, the phrase-the steps of a good man are ordered came across my mind. In fact Ive
read this verse before but I hadnt read it lately. As I began to ponder that in my mind, I thought about
the many situations I didnt foresee stepping into. Here is not the place in life I thought Id be walking. At
times it seemed like Ive crept along in the valley of the shadow of death. The shadows and echoes of the
enemy threaten to overtake me. You mean even those tiny steps in the darkness were ordered too, Lord?
But what about the steps I took along the paths that I was sure to be the right way but it only led to a
dead end? And what about the steps I consciously made away from rather than toward you? Could they
have been ordered too?
While I walked up this steep hill, that I usually choose to walk down because its easier, I was reminded of
the hard places that I have journeyed through. Countless days I was unsure if I could press out another step
and other days I was tempted to turn and walk the opposite way. But with the passing of time, I found
those small strained steps had taken me to another place. With the change happening so gradually, I had
not realized I had moved. The movement was not always physically but my perception, my hope, my faith,
my attitude, my thinking moved.
Perhaps if we had to choose, most of us would prefer to walk continually along the smooth path. But despite
where you find yourself (even those detours we knowingly take) there is One, who never loses sight of you.
If youre in a dark, dry or hard place just keep walking for the landscape is sure to change. No, I dont give
the false claim that itll happen today, tomorrow, or even this month BUT it could. Yet with assurance, I

say that if you refuse to stop, you will step onto new terrain.

”Life’s not a level or a smooth road; but it’s a blessing to breast the hills and trudge over the stones with a good
heart, and I think one sometimes does one’s best work on the uphill bits, though one may not know it.” Bishop Paget

Great post Wanda. The beauty about it all is that even when we take steps out of the plan HE has for us, He always
has a back-up plan to bring us right back on track. That’s because nothing surprises Him.
Blessings,
Vickie
```

```
Gregg (2010-05-15 22:22:09)
All of our steps are ordered by the Lord. Even the ”ones that seemed to lead to a dead end.” God orders them for a
reason, hopefully, as He reveals the reason we are open and responsive. There is no plan B or back up plan with God
- everything He does is sovereign and ordained prior the creation of this world.
He is also teaching, blessing, discipling, disciplining, correcting, buidling us in every step. I am afraid we miss so much
of it becasue we are not in tune to him but to the things around us.
```

```
Wanda (2010-05-17 01:02:21)
Thanks to each of you for sharing your thoughts. I believe that God in His sovereignty always knows the steps we
will take even before we take them. However, I believe that sometimes we make choices that lead us into taken longer
routes than He had wished for us. Just like in the case of the Israelites. But He is able to reroute us back to the
correct path.
```

## Finding My Strength (2010-05-16 03:14)

For the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says, ”Only in returning to me and waiting for me will you
be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength. But you would have none of it. Isaiah 30: 15 (NLT)
This is the passage of scripture I’m meditating on today. I also like the message translation of this passage.
God, the Master, The Holy of Israel, has this solemn counsel: ”Your salvation requires you to turn back to
me and stop your silly efforts to save yourselves. Your strength will come from settling down in complete
dependence on meThe very thing you’ve been unwilling to do. (The Message)
Do you find yourself tired of toiling while trying to hold things together or come up with some type of
solution? Perhaps it’s time to silence the ranting, turn back and confidently wait on Him.

## Quiet Confidence (2010-05-17 22:00)

In [1]Saturdays post I shared how I was reflecting on Isaiah 30:15, particularly the part about in quietness
and confidence is my strength. Today, I wanted to share some questions and insights I received while con-
tinuing to meditate.

What is it that one needs to have confidence in?

• That God exists
• That God is who He says He is
• That He can do what He says He can
• That not only can He do it but Hes willing ( this is important because a person may have the ability
to do a thing but has no desire or willingness to do so)
• That God is concerned about you (yep, the same God that holds the universe together is interested in
you)
• That He is able to hold things together even when it appears that things are falling apart

When do I need to exhibit quietness?

• When tempted to continue to argue your point, choose quietness instead.
• When you would worry and be stressed out, quiet your mind instead.
• When you be tempted to run and hide, quiet your steps and be still instead.
• When it would be easy to complain, quiet the dis-ease with thanksgiving and praise.

those who choose to listen.
Blessings, Wanda!

Such great words of advice. It’s like the admonition always given to writers: ”Show, don’t tell.”
Likewise, don’t brag about what you can do, just quietly do it and speak through your actions. Or don’t preach to
me about what God’s going to do to me, but show me how God works through you by your actions.

## Your View of Windows (2010-05-21 11:18)

I was just curious to know if any you have upgraded to Windows 7. If so what has been your experience
with the new version? Ive had my installation disks for months now but have not taken the time to install
the software on my laptop.
Happy Friday

WELCOME TO MY WORLD OF POETRY: (2010-05-21 11:32:44)
I have to get a new laptop, on looking most are windows 7 so I’d be grateful also if anyone could let me know.
Yvonne,
```

Rae (2010-05-21 12:00:37)
My new laptop came with Windows 7 and I actually like it a lot. Especially when you have several screens going for
internet searches- they pop up from the bar and you can see them all at a glance- click one and you are there.
Also, we got an (HDMI ?) cable, connected it to the laptop and the TV and can watch movies, read blogs and do FB
on my big flat screen!

Karen (2010-05-21 12:39:21)
I have not personally, but two of my techie sons have upgraded...they really Windows 7 and said the transition was
so much smoother than from XP to Vista....

Andrea (2010-05-21 14:56:46)
I have mixed emotions....
Blessings, andrea

Lorena G. Sims (2010-05-22 00:01:21)
I love it and so far I have not encounter any problems with it...it’s a way way lot better than windows vista.

Ellie (2010-05-22 00:53:00)
The Techies in our house, installed and and loved it. At first a few
glitches, but now, everyone is happy!

Wanda (2010-05-22 02:11:08)
Thank you ladies for sharing your experiences. Rae that sounds like a nifty set up you have, I’m jealous :) I’m sure
I’ll get around to upgraded my laptop soon.

Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-05-22 03:33:19)
...i have Vista and ”detest” it! preferred XP over this OS. the only advantage Vista has over XP was/is i can have
several sites open at once. perfect for blogging! 7 sounds appealing...

Lisa (2010-05-22 04:14:11)
I need to get a new laptop first. :) I’m sure when I do it will have 7 on it. Let us know what you think once you get
it installed!
And have a wonderful weekend sis. I’m going to go enjoy an onion now. (just kidding) :O)

## It’s Him You Seek (2010-05-24 16:00)

[1] Photo by [2]Heartlight Jesus is the Messiah you seek.
Acts 5:42b

The apostles in Acts went about sharing this message back in Bible times and that same message holds true
today. We often seek salvation and satisfaction in many things-jobs, relationships, promotions, achievements,
and/or accolades but there is only one that truly SAVES and SATISFIES.

## Teaser Tuesday (2010-05-25 22:17)

Being the book lover that I am and having finished reading a great book, I decided to participate in Teaser
Tuesdays today.
Teaser Tuesdays is a weekly bookish meme, hosted by MizB of [1]Should Be Reading, which I discovered
over at [2]Readin N Writin with Patricia. Anyone can play along! Just do the following:
Grab your current read
Open to a random page
Share two (2) teaser sentences from somewhere on that page
BE CAREFUL NOT TO INCLUDE SPOILERS! (make sure that what you share doesnt give too much
away! You dont want to ruin the book for others!)
Share the title & author, too, so that other TT participants can add the book to their TBR Lists if they like
your teasers!
MY TEASER

```
”Each piece of jewelry felt like chains of bondage, and the clothing he had slipped to her made
her burn in shame. Never had she dressed so provactively, but the garments he asked her to wear
for him turned her into a Jezebel.” A Stray Drop of Blood by Roseanna M. White, pg 76
```

Reading a good book? Do share

Reminds me a bit of ”Blood of Flowers”, a bit of historical fiction set in the old Ottoman Empire. It’s about a young
woman with a gift for weaving rugs who is forced to become a concubine at one point. Sad in a way, but she perseveres.

## Lessons Learned Along the Way (2010-05-26 23:55)

As a part of Exemplify Online Singles Channel, Christy has asked Sassy Single Bloggers to share what God
has taught them so far this year. Whether you’re single or married, you are likely to find something of
interest at [1]Exemplify Online. There are a number of things He’s been revealing during the year but a few
key things jump out at me. Here they are:

• At the beginning of the year He impressed upon my heart that it would be year of unveiling for me.
I’ve spent several years in a sort of spiritual slumber and going through the motions of life. Only to
find when I awaken, I had no clear understanding of how I got there. Constantly questioning within
myself-what happened?
• He’s been gradually revealing strategies the enemy has used to stifle my mobility.
• He’s teaching me that it’s ok to try again. Some places are worth revisiting because the experience
doesn’t have to be the same. See my post [2]Revisiting the Tomb for more.
• That He desires to use me in service to Him
• Teaching me to rest more in Him
• Better days do come eventually
• That I am enough
• I’ve never been forsaken-without support, protection, or adequate help. See my posts entitled [3]Never
Forsaken and [4]Never Forsaken Part 2 for more on this.
• Importance of recognizing and celebrating the small victories. Most of the time our healing or over-
coming doesn’t come immediately but over time. See [5]Celebration Time Come On
• Importance of capturing the God-thoughts. So many ideas, wisdoms, lessons are forgotten and never
utilized because we don’t write them down.
• Expand my horizons-try new things, talk with new people, go to new places and blogging just happens
to be one the new things I’ve been doing this year, which has given me the opportunity to meet each
of you.
• Despite how long a particular place in your life has been dry or void, does not mean it will always be
that way. There’s a distinct difference between barren and bare and it takes a trained eye to know the
difference. See [6]Bare but Not Barren for more on this.

I think that’s enough for now. Are there any particular lessons that you’ve been gleaning from the Master
Teacher this year?

Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-05-27 00:04:55)
hi Wanda:)
an excellent post! Re-visiting the Tomb was/is...as well!!!
```

```
wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-05-27 00:50:52)
Just as I suspected... The Lord continues to teach me through the lessons of others. He’s so faithful that way. I can
relate to so many of your lessons, as well. ”He’s been gradually revealing strategies the enemy has used to stifle my
mobility.” This one really caught me. For me, the tactic used to paralyze me is always fear. I’m so thankful to the
Lord for revealing this to me, then nudging me to keep moving. Thank you, Wanda, for sharing your ”lessons learned
along the way”.
```

```
Ellie (2010-05-27 02:53:37)
These are great; for me, patience and persistence. I have some goals
to accomplish, not just personal ones. I want to get my family to walk for some causes, volunteer and
etc. Try, try again...
```

```
WELCOME TO MY WORLD OF POETRY: (2010-05-27 06:40:51)
An excellent post Wanda, enjoyed the read.
Yvonne,
```

```
Rae (2010-05-27 10:18:22)
I’ve learned to not let people suck me into their troubled worlds and hearts. When someone gets negative or nasty- I
just walk away. A year ago- I would have nodded in agreement and taken their side. just to fit in and not be shunned.
Life is so much better with positive insights and daily prayer.
```

```
Mike (2010-05-27 11:35:14)
Importance of recognizing and celebrating the small victories. Most of the time our healing or overcoming doesn’t come
immediately but over time. I like this one.
My lesson this year is that I am too self sufficient and need to lean on Him in everything, that’s EVERYTHING, not
just the things I don’t think I can cope with.
Blessings :)
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-05-27 14:22:11)
The more I live the more I believe, without doubting, that His Word is the most important thing in my life.
```

```
Wanda (2010-05-31 19:02:47)
Thank you Bud, Yvonne,!
Monica, fear has been one for me as well.
Rae, it’s so easy to just go along with others are saying.
Mike, that’s a great lesson. I think we’re often guilty of believing we can handle the small stuff. Although God word
urges us to acknowledge Him in all our ways.
Bluebutterfly, good one!
```

## The If(s) (2010-05-27 08:30)

If, is such a small word but one that often has one looking back in regret. At other times it has us glancing
fearfully toward the future wondering if I should, could or would. [1]Ellie tagged me to participate in an ”If
I were” themed meme.
If I were a MONTH: I’d be January because its when everyone is focusing on the possibilities of what could
be in the new year, while saying goodbye to the year gone by.
If I were a DAY: I’d be Saturday because its a day to slow down from work and spend it doing the things
you love.
If I were a TIME OF DAY: I’d be the time when the sun first cracks the sky to wash away the darkness of
the night.
If I were a SEASON: I’d be spring because its when new things are budding forth.
If I were a PLANET: I’d be Earth.
If I were a DIRECTION: I’d be pointing up towards Heaven.
If I were a TREE: I’d like to be planted by the waters.
If I were an ANIMAL: I’d be a lion bold and fierce.
If I were a: MUSICAL INSTRUMENT I’d be a flute.
If I were a FRUIT: I’d be white seedless grapes because theyre my favorite.
If I were a FOOD: I’d be chocolate loved by many and useful in many applications.
If I were a COLOR: I’d be blue coloring the sky or the ocean.
If I were a BOOK: Id be Proverbs because it holds so much wisdom for everyday life.
If I were a SONG: I’d be a slow tune.
If I were a MOVIE: I’d probably be a rather boring one.
If I were a FLOWER: I’d be a tulip swaying in the wind.
If I were a FACIAL EXPRESSION: I’d be expressing wonder because there are so many things I ponder
about in this life.
Now I’m suppose to tag someone, so if you’re reading this post and you’ve yet to participate in it consider
yourself tagged, my friend.

## Favorite Finds (2010-05-31 21:35)

Last week I came across a couple of interesting or inspiring reads as I explored the blogosphere. My intention
was to post this on Friday or Saturday but unfortunately, I didn’t get the task completed. So here are a few
of my favorite finds from last week:

• Does Facebook consume much of your time? If so you might want to take Rae’s approach over at
[1]Porch Ponderings by Rae.
• Feeling like arts and crafts, you might like the cute printable projects at [2]Kind Over Matter.
• Hesitant about giving love a go again, you may enjoy [3]Are You Missing Out on the Main Attraction
in Life over at Highly Favored.
• If you’re like me your life could be seasoned with a bit more grace. Learn about how grace presents
itself in everyday living in Rachel’s [4]True Grace post.
• Sonya at Becoming a Strong Wife, Mother, and Friend provides a great article about [5]Waiting on the
Lord.

On another note, I’d like to extend my thanks for the awards I was given a few weeks ago. Sorry it has taken
me so long to pass them forward.

GlowinGirl at Sugar Tails was such a sweetie and awarded me (to my surprise) The Versatile Blogger award.
According to the rules of the award I’m to tell you seven things about myself and pass the award on to other
bloggers that I’ve recently discovered and think are fantastic. Here’s my seven:

1. I’m basically dysfunctional late at night. Never been a party animal :0)
2. I’d choose Coke over Pepsi.
3. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes.
4. I don’t have any children just my dog, Bella.
5. I hate listening to music while waiting on someone to answer their cell phone. It drives me crazy.
6. I tend to only listen to music in the car
7. I’m an introvert.

[6]

I’d like to pass the award on to: Monica at [7]Wisdom, Virtue & Rubies, [8]Empowering Your Life with
Cheryl Pullins, [9]Just Another Clay Pot, [10]From His Heart to Mine, [11]Nana’s Reflection and [12]A
Pilgrim’s Project

[13] Yvonne at [14]Welcome to My Word of Poetry recently awarded me with
the From Me to You Award and I’d like to pass it onto [15]Karen, [16]GlowinGirl, [17]Patricia, Thanks to
each of them and if you haven’t already visited these blogs mentioned, please stop by when you get a chance.

## Shammah! (2010-06-01 17:30)

Did you know that God has a sense a humor? Over the weekend, Hes managed to give me my own personal
illustrated lesson. As I was doing my morning walk with my dog Friday morning, we came across two black
barking dogs. Startled by their presence and their barking, I momentarily halted. Unsure if I should turn
around or continue going forward, I quickly analyzed my options. There was no way I could out run them
and they were already inching closer and closer to us. In spite of the fear, I quickly picked up a rock and
began commanding the dogs to get back. Although they didnt stop barking or completely retreat, they only
came so close to us and caused us no physical harm. The closer I got to my house, I couldnt help but laugh
at how courageous I would look to someone passing by. My arm raised with a rock in hand ready to slay
those Goliaths. Yet fear had besieged my mind. God brought the story of Shammah to mind as I neared
home. In 2 Samuel 23: 11-12, the Bible tells Shammahs story of how he courageously defended himself in
the middle of a field of lentils against the Philistines while other members of the Israelite army retreated.
God used the run in with the dogs to remind me that is how the enemy does. He attempts to corner us
where our options seem to be one of two choices-retreat or defeat. The odd thing is that I had seen one of
these dogs at other times during the week when walking but the dog always quickly turned and ran in the
opposite direction of us. But on this particular morning there were two dogs, which looked like twins that
had combined their forces and were now ready to attack. Double teaming is another tactic used. He comes
at us in multiply ways to weaken our defenses. However, when we make up our mind that retreating is not
option, well find that God has given us the strength to confront and win.
After getting the victory, imagine my surprise when the next evening I walked out in my yard to discover
those same two enemies in my back yard of all places. They did bark but as I was urging them to get out of
my yard, it was them that were confused this time. For some reason, they couldnt remember how they had
entered the yard and as my nephew and I were trying to lead them out, they began to try to hide. It seemed
my lesson wasnt quite over. There was still more for me to glean from this situation. Why or how the dogs
managed to find themselves in my yard of behooves me. But it did show me that our enemy doesnt give
up easily. Just because we face one encounter and win doesnt mean will not find ourselves confronting the
exact same enemy. But do not allow their resurgence to cause you to draw back.
Are there places in your life that you’ve been retreating in fear? I learned that the absence of fear was not
necessary. Only the courage to keep walking and not back down in spite of it was really what I needed. Did
you confront a situation and assumed you had gotten the victory only to see it come back with a vengeance?
If so be determined to stand your ground again.
Father, I pray that you reveal to us those areas in our lives that we’ve been refusing to confront due to fear.

Give us the courage, oh Lord, to forge ahead in the strength that you have given us. We thank you that you
teach our hands to war. Thank you for strategic tactics to defeat our enemies. Thank you that it is you,
who give us the victory.

Thanks for the good word!

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-06-02 00:24:34)
I’m learning that sometimes we have it twisted. We think that fear is supposed to go away in order for us to move
forward, but really we’re supposed to move forward in the face of fear. I love how our Father will encourage us with
His word and evidence of His character and principles in everyday encounters like 2 crazy dogs on your path and in
your yard. The NERVE of the enemy, and then the Glory of the Almighty! I love it! Thank you for sharing this. I’m
adding it to my ”list” of lessons from my walk the other day. ;-)
```

```
Trudy (2010-06-02 01:39:28)
A beautiful post Wanda and what a powerful message the Lord delivered to you through the dogs. He does show up
in the most unlikely places, doesn’t He?
Praise Him indeed that He has already defeated the prince of this earth!!!!
God bless you dear!

No mam, Lisa, you’re not defeated. Many are the afflications of the righteous but He delivers out of the ALL.
Dance!Dance! Bluebutterfly
Lorena, yes the enemies persistence causes us to retreat at times.
Yvonne, blessings to you.
Karen, victory is certain to come!
@Wisdom, I agree with you about us thinking that in order to move fear must not be present. But somethings we’d
never do if we want to all the fear was gone.
@ Trudy,Yes He’s quite funny. Maybe I wasn’t paying close enough attention when Shammah’s story was ministered
at service a couple of weeks ago.
@Ruth, thank you & I’m honored that God would speak to you through something I wrote.

Ellie (2010-06-02 04:10:46)
I can relate, had a Dr appointment today and wanted to retreat and run!
I was fearful of a panic attack; I didn’t have one, but I have before.
I kept telling myself, it will be over soon and I can leave. It was a victory to keep calm and carry on!
I haven’t had one in awhile, but it is a reminder when I get in uncomfortable situation that it could occur
It did seem like, this was a lesson, to see those dogs in your yard...You handled it well!!!

Beth in NC (2010-06-02 11:29:04)
Oh Wanda! What a powerful lesson! You’re right, that is just like the devil. And interesting that the attack came to
your own home! And the ”back yard” makes me think of a ”back door” ... just looking for an opening. Argh. I can’t
stand him.
What a wonderful post! I’m going to ask others to come read this if you don’t mind.
Love,
Beth

## No Incompletes in God (2010-06-03 07:00)

[1]

This morning (which will be yesterday by the time you read this) God began to speak to my heart that He
was one that finishes. He brings things into completion. Not wanting to let that God thought slip away from
me I jotted it in my journal and went about my daily tasks. However, during the worship service tonight the
same phrases were brought to mind again. He reminded me that He is not like humans that will start out on
journey with you but drop out mid-trip. Hes not even like me, who will start projects with good intentions
only to end up deciding the cost to finish was more than I expected. He is Alpha and Omega and the God
of the in between as well. Just like the street in front of my home eventual ends and one has to decide to
either turn right or left, God is bringing some situations in my life to the end. The journey will not end put
that portion will be wrapped up. I dont know where you are on your road with God but Id just like to
encourage you that God does not leave things in an incomplete state. Just as some roads or trips are longer
than others, certain stages of our lives last longer than others.

Very good word, Wanda. Thank you!

Just Be Real (2010-06-04 00:37:41)
WoW! Wanda I certainly needed to see those words that I am not a mistake and that there is no incompletes in God’s
word. Amen. Thank you.

Thank you for this message today. It is exactly what I needed to hear about a particular situation in my life right
now and I know God was speaking to me through you. Bless you.

Ellie (2010-06-04 03:03:03)
Well put; I have been in limbo for a bit. You are so right, about the stages! We need to know sometimes the timing
isn’t right! Thanks

Wanda (2010-06-04 03:35:03)
Sonya and Barbie, glad to have you guys as my newest followers. Thanks to each of you that commented. I felt a
nudge to share what God had spoken to me last night and quickly typed it up before retiring. Sometimes ideas come
to me but I never get around to writing but He wouldn’t let me get away with it this time. Your comments were
confirmation to me.

Bud Ezekiel H. (2010-06-04 03:52:47)

Although I know this, it is good to be reminded and He knows how to at just the precise time. Thank you for sharing.
Love and blessings my sister.

Erin (2010-06-08 20:31:24)
Hi Wanda!
Thanks for stopping by my blog the other day! This post reminds me of what I wrote for Christy yesterday. It is so
easy to forget that He is still working on us (and in us). I am so thankful that I have a Savior who doesn’t forget or
give up on me.
In Christ,
Erin

Living Water (2010-06-15 09:39:28)
So much truth in this! Yes, Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2 KJV).
```

## Interesting Finds (2010-06-04 09:00)

As I cruised cyberspace this week, I came across some posts that made me laugh; others made me ponder,
while others sparked my creativity or challenged me. This week’s picks are:

• I love Laurie’s analogy in [1]A Piece of My Heart-Shake Up.
• Over at [2]Organic Enchilada I was reminded why I fear the messy little ones.
• [3]Spiritual Fuel issued up a dose of reality about boredom in our spiritual lives at times.
• Susan at Forever His encouraged me to keep moving whether [4]I’m walking, running, or flying.
• Linda at [5]By the Way did a great job in pointing out possible reasons for pruning.
• Feeling lucky and want to enter some giveaways [6]here you’ll find a whole list of them.
• If you find yourself gripped by fear, you might enjoy [7]Paralysis from Fear at Purposed Princess.
• Need some unique party planning ideas, check out [8]Celebrations at Home.

Those are just a few of the many great posts I’ve read this week. And I’d like to thank all of you, who have
taken the time to stop by my place during the week. There are a lot of places to visit in blogland and I’m
honored that you choose to spend a few moments here.
Now tell me about something you read this week that caught your attention or gave you a good laugh.
P.S. I almost forgot this one, ChristianAudio is giving away a free download of Francis Chan’s [9]Forgotten
God: Reversing Our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit audiobook this month. Use coupon code JUN2010.

## Making Sense of the Nonsense (2010-06-06 02:37)

Today marks a week ago since I learned about the tragic deaths of a former schoolmate and her two children
in a fiery crash in Texas. When I heard the news I was shocked. Although I hadnt seen her for some
time, I remembered how she was such a beautiful girl with a sweet spirit. Seeing photos of her and family,
revealed the same beauty I remembered. According to newspaper articles, she and her family were living the
American dream. I couldnt make sense of not only she but her two children being taken from the earth in
such away. Why was her family left to mourn not one or two but three deaths in the same family?
Heading to church on last Sunday, my spirit was heavy. Of course, I knew that God was good but I couldnt
see His goodness being extended to her family. I thought about how her mother and sisters must have felt
and prayed that He would strengthen and comfort them. As I listened to the message, I was reminded of
the sovereignty of God. Because He is sovereign nothing gets pass His ever watching eye because He neither

sleeps nor slumbers. With further reflection, I saw His miraculous work in how her injured husband was
rescued from the crash by some courageous individuals.
The whys of the event are still unanswered but my heart is back in peace with the Master today. Realizing
that His ways are not like mine. Daily Im surrounded by His goodness. So many things I take for granted.
Will you please join me in praying for her family at this difficult time?

LisaShaw (2010-06-06 20:50:41)
Wanda,
I began praying as I read... I will continue to pray for her precious family.
You hit it on the head with one word: SOVEREIGN. GOD is indeed Sovereign – His ways are not our ways and as
such we will not understand some things especially as it relates to the death of loved ones and friends BUT I rest in
knowing that HE is sovereign and His plans for us are NOT void of HIS love for us.
Praying...
and saddened for the tender hearts of the loved ones who I know are in pain. May God’s peace and comfort pour over
them.
Blessings...

Wanda (2010-06-06 23:28:58)
Thanks to each of you for including this family in your prayers. On this side of eternity the whys are often left
unanswered but I believe that God will surround this family in their time of bereavement.

## Discarded Things (2010-06-08 05:01)

As I walked this morning, my mind began to reflect on my walking companion-my sweet dog Bella. Just a
couple of years ago, she found herself among discarded cats and dogs at a local humane society. Its uncertain
how she found herself there. Perhaps at one time, she had loving owners, who through no fault of their own
could no longer provide for her. So they thought it best to send her away. Or maybe, she was a prize
possession that simply got lost and couldnt find her way back home. For whatever reasons, she was among
the lost or discarded.
Yet today, she smells all fresh from her bath last night. Shes fed and has toys, comfy bed, ribbons and
even a few clothes. She has everything that she needs and my sister jokingly says Bella is living better than
she ever lived in life. If thats true or not I dont know but as I thought about her, I thought about how
we sometimes find ourselves discarded by others. Whether it is through divorces, broken friendships, or job
terminations, someone somewhere decided you were no longer useful. The scenarios are different but the
outcome or feelings are the same-discarded like a napkin or once beloved toy.
But just as Bella found a new place to belong, God does the same thing for us. Although others couldnt
perceive our value, He will connect us with others, who will embrace that which was discarded. And well
find our latter end more enjoyable than what we experienced in the past.
Lord, I thank you that even when others throw us way, you never leave us. We thank you for connections
with others, wholl embrace and cherish that in which youve placed in us. Forgive us for how we failed to
see the value in others and we pray that you will connect them to individuals who will nurture them. In
Jesus name.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-06-08 14:03:39)
Hallelujah! One of my fave passages in the Bible says to pick up the fragments that remain so that nothing is lost.
Our Savior is absolutely awesome!!!

One Heart (2010-06-08 14:35:34)
Wanda, you don’t know how much this blesses me today. The timing is perfect as yesterday I found myself in painful
tears from this very same feeling at a home school group. I began with so much joy little over a month and poured
out love and joy to others, but the leadership is harsh, cold, unreceptive of God’s goodness and has basically worn me
out. I felt very discarded but then God showed me how He had placed me there for the others who were receiving His
goodness. To some we are a sweet fragrance–those who are being saved. So I must go on.
Would you mind if I shared this post with a group of ladies? I think it will bless them.
Thanks for stopping by yesterday. Blessings my sister.

LisaShaw (2010-06-08 15:46:39)
Amen and Amen Wanda!
As a child of GOD, a HUGE dog lover (owner of two), and someone who knows what it is to be discarded by people
– I can FULLY relate to this message.
What I love is this: ”But just as Bella found a new place to belong, God does the same thing for us. Although others
couldnt perceive our value, He will connect us with others, who will embrace that which was discarded. And well
find our latter end more enjoyable than what we experienced in the past.”
That says it all for me! So thankful to the LORD!
Blessings to you!

Monica Watkins (2010-06-08 20:33:23)
Beautiful post. Beautiful prayer. I’ve been on both sides of this scenario. I have been discarded, and I’m quite sure I
have, for whatever reason, discarded others. I’m so thankful that the Lord has protects us all.
Monica

## Extinguish My Drought, Lord (2010-06-09 10:28)

[1]

```
For I will give you abundant water to quench your thirst and to moisten your parched fields.
And I will pour out my Spirit and my blessings on your children. They will thrive like watered
grass, like willows on riverbanks.
```

Isaiah 44:3-4 is a scripture I’ve been meditating on and praying over my extended family for the past few
days. Thirst has been a recurring theme for me this year.
At times, I’ve been guilty of using substitute sources in an attempt to quench my thirsty soul. For there
are many to choose. But despite the initial happiness they bring, the satisfaction is only momentary. Thus
I need the Lord to send His water as promised. Being who He is, God doesn’t give a little but sends an
abundance of water to not only me but also to moisten my fields.
On first reading, one may be tempted to overlook the phrase, moisten your parched fields since many of us
don’t have natural fields. However, the phrase is still very relevant to us today. It was in the fields were one
worked, gathered food for their families and ministered to needy by leaving portions of the field for them to
glean from. The field is place of activity and expected productivity. No farmer plows, plants, and waters
without the expectation of reaping a harvest. Yet, when we are dry spiritually, the activities we’re involved
in become laborious and yield little lasting produce. We find ourselves going through the motions, while our
jobs, family time, and ministry endeavors have become lifeless. The good news is that it doesn’t have to stay
that way. Simply go back to the real Source for a fresh drink.
_Today, I extend my prayers to each of you. May every substitute water source be displaced in your lives. Thus_
_making room for the authentic thirst quencher. I pray that every dry place would be filled to the overflow_
_with His presence. May His Spirit and blessings be on you and your family. In Jesus Name._

May we always cling to Him so that we can reap a bountiful harvest for His kingdom.

of my favorite books!
Loved this!

Will Burke (2010-06-09 11:52:30)
Dry times are natural, or else, how would we know when we’ve been filled? Jesus wouldn’t allow tabernacles to be
built on the mountain top.

GlowinGirl (2010-06-09 11:58:16)
God is so good to allow us to continue to thirst until we fill up with Him! May He fill up all those parched places in
all of us. Blessings to you, friend!

Beautiful. No alternative sources, just THE SOURCE of Life in our lives!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-06-09 13:36:05)
Amen! Jesus answered her, ”If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked
Him and He would have given you living water.” - John 4:10
May we cling to You, Lord, our source of life.

Happy WFW Wanda!!!
Please join me on Pursuit of Titus 2 for a blog party that you can not miss!!! I am hosting a True Woman Manifesto
Blog Party courtesy of Revive Our Hearts with Nancy Leigh Demoss. Please, I encourage you to link up with this

blessed event. Click the link below to find out more and I hope to see you ALL there! May God Bless you!!! It is
time for us as women to embrace our Biblical role as women, wives and mothers according to Titus 2 and Proverbs
31...We need to take back what the feminist movement tried to start in destroying our Biblical roles and get back to
what GOD said through HIS word! I Hope to see you there!

Your prayer is so appreciated, and I pray for you also, that we would be able to be overcomers of, as you said, any
substitute water source, and that we will indeed be filled to overflow with His presence. Thank you, Wanda!
Blessings,

## You Choose What to Carry (2010-06-10 12:09)

[1]

Lord, help us to carry our cross daily.

Heal our hearts so that we may carry love rather than hate.

Help us to carry peace rather than strife.

May we carry hope rather than despair.
Remove bitterness so that we may carry your joy.
Help us to be carriers of the good news of the Gospel rather than gossip.
In Jesus name, Amen

## Like Three P’s in a Pod (2010-06-11 13:52)

[1]

No, not your vegetables but Prayer, Purpose, and Passion. I don’t know about you but I definitely need
more of all three of those. So when I discovered that Beth Jones was hosting the _3 P’s in a Pod for_
_Christian Women: Prayer, Purpose, and Passion_ webinar, I registered for the event. It’s scheduled for
today at 10:30AM CDT and you don’t even have to leave the comfort of your own home or office. For more
information or to register visit [2]Empowering Christian Woman

Brian the old man (2010-06-11 17:21:10)
Prayer, Purpose and Passion sound a whole lot better than veggies. lol I wish I could have attended, maybe next
time. I hope you enjoyed it. God bless.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-06-11 18:02:46)
Not long ago I wrote a poem....about a garden pea. I think Arlee would remember it,
was before the A to Z challenge.
I enjoyed your three ”Ps” very good ideal.
enjoy your week-end.
Yvonne.

I love the ”3 peas in a pod” anology. I wish I’d been available for the webinar. How was it?
```

```
Wanda (2010-06-12 17:48:41)
Yes, yes...I enjoyed it very much. Perhaps I’ll get around to sharing to a few of the notes I took.
Beth said she came up with the play on words due to the three P(s) from prayer,purpose, and passion and pod because
she is playing to place the podcast of the webinar on her website as a product.
Brian, I’m with you those p’s are much more advertising to me since I’m not fond of peas.
Yvonne, it surprising me how you’re able to write about all types of subject matter through poems.
Thanks Bev, morgue file has lots of free to use photos.

## Things That Made Me Go...Hmmm (2010-06-12 17:42)

As usual I read some great posts as I ventured out in blog world, today I’m sharing just a few of those that
made me go hmmmmmm:

• I found Twinkle Mom via Word Filled Wednesday and her post [1]Psalm 1:2-His Word made me
reexamine how much time I actually spend reading the Word.
• Yvonne over at Welcome to My World of Poetry is a very talented poet. Her poem, [2]That’s All I
Ask of You, gives some great advice to children and parents.
• For those feeling like they may have married the wrong mate, Adding Zest to Your Nest has a great
article entitled [3]Keeping Covenant. Here’s a quote from the article:

```
”God can take our bad situations, our covenant with the wrong man, and be glorified and
show Himself strong through it. There are consequences for disobedience, but God’s grace can
not only forgive, but it brings blessings out of sins and failures. God will fight for us just as He
did for Israel.”
```

• I’m using [4]Saucy tips, which I found at [5]Tidy Mom for the perfect cupcakes from a mix everytime
today for the cupcakes I’m baking for church.
• And I’m thinking of trying to make the [6]Marshmallow Pops from Hostess with the Mostess. They’re
too cute and I think the kids may get a kick out of them.
• If you find yourself comparing your blog to others, Gather Inspirit offers some great words of wisdom
in the post titled [7]Blogger Envy.
• Sword of Goliath has a thought provoking post entitled [8]Dance For Me, Mr. President.
• Lisa at Sharing Life with Lisa shares a timely God whisper in [9]Daughter Bare Down. Don’t worry
mean this word is good for you as well.
• Monica at Wisdom Virtue and Rubies had me questioning if I accept God’s first answer or do I seek
something better in her [10]Lesson from a Crockpot Chicken.

Those are just a few of the many inspirational reads I came across this week. I encourage you to pay these
blogs a visit as you have time. My goal is only to share interesting posts from others that I feel you may
enjoy reading as well. Each of your blogs offer something unique and very valuable. I encourage you to keep
on keeping on because I blessed each time I visit one you. Thanks so much to each of you who continue to
stop by from time to time. Your kindness is greatly appreciated.Well I’ve got to run the cupcakes are calling.
Wishing you a safe and fun filled weekend.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-06-12 19:37:46)
Thank you Wanda for including me in your list. It was strange how that poem came about, I heard the song”That’s
All I Ask Of You ” on the radio one day and thought I could make a poem out of that title. There was a bit of an
atmosphere in the family so I sat down and wrote how I felt.
Have a good week-end.

I’m getting ready to push! Love you for sharing so much good food ;0)

## Where Does the Time Go? (2010-06-15 08:00)

What book are you giving the most face time? God’s book, Facebook or perhaps some other book? Sometimes
I found myself amazed at how much time had managed to slip away as I meandered around on Facebook
tending to fish, raising crops, whizzing up meals in the cafÈ, or checking the latest friend’s status. And it’s
no secret...I LOVE books and reading has been my favorite past time since I was little girl.
Joshua 1:8 us reminds of the importance of time in God’s book.
_This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that_
_you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous,_
_and then you shall deal wisely and have good success.(AMP)_
It can not be in my mouth or mind, if I haven’t first put it before my eyes and ears. Every now and then a
little adjustment is needed. So lately I’ve been weaning myself away from Facebook and spending less time
with other books in order to give God’s Word more face time.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-06-15 09:45:05)
Yes on can get absorbed with what is going on either on facebook or blogger as long as we don’t ignore what is going
on in the outside world,
Enjoy your day,
Yvonne.

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-06-15 14:09:30)
Wow, Wanda. I did the same thing with FB about a month ago. I now only use it to connect with clients and
associates outside my immediate geographic area.
```

```
One Heart (2010-06-15 14:37:34)
Wanda, right on target as usual. If you read my page titled, ”About Me?” you’ll see how God practically had to pry
my hands open for me to let go of facebook. I fought Him for so long, but guess who wins when wrestling with God?
;) The moment I let go of the very thing He was asking me to let go of, on the other side was something better. He
opened up the opportunity to minister through the blog and it is a whole other world here. Facebook tends to sap
life out of us. The multitude of comments which go on your page before one can approve them and by the time you
can delete them they’ve spread the venom causing offenses left and right. There are so many more distractions there
too with the games which add up to nothing. I know that if we’re not careful we can get distracted here in Blog Land
too, but another friend shared how it is a much more purposeful place when used correctly. I agree.
In the end, none of it makes any sense if we are too distracted from abiding in His Word and in His presence. Good
post my sister.
```

```
Missie (2010-06-15 14:48:18)
I have decided that i am only going to read novels, magazines and the like on weekend. Blogs and the Bible are my
only weekday friends.
I probably should start less time on Facebook or Twitter too!
```

Thanks for your post!

Joanne Sher (2010-06-15 16:32:35)
Good for you, Wanda. Thanks for this reminder. I likely need to do the same. Thanks.

AnooCre8ion (2010-06-15 18:50:06)
Great post Wanda. It’s something I too am very conscious of as I meander around facebook and blogland. I so love
the Word and don’t want to put anything before it.
blessings,
vickie

Lorena G. Sims (2010-06-15 21:45:55)
Great post Wanda. I barely check my facebook account anymore because I got to the point that it’s the first thing I
read when I woke up in the morning and the last thing I do before going to bed. It’s just not right!

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-06-15 23:09:38)
Great post, Wanda. It’s funny, I just asked you what you were reading these days (see email). Then your post came.
I believe the FB novelty is wearing off for many of us, as the Holy Spirit convicts about time spent there. There is
just no substitute for time in God’s word. Thank you for reminding us of that.

Karen (2010-06-16 00:02:28)
Amen! You are right on the mark with this post...

̃Amy ̃ (2010-06-16 23:22:26)
This was a powerful little post! Wow...so meant for me!! I have been struggling with getting back into His Word and
I love how you said ”It can not be in my mouth or mind if I haven’t first put it before my eyes and ears.” So good and
so very true!!
Thank you for stopping by my blog today...so glad you did, otherwise I may not have found your blog and this post!
P.S. I have been praying about becoming more dedicating and disciplined to reading my Word on a daily basis that
God has lead me to participate in the challenge of reading through the Bible in 90 Days! I am really looking forward
to it and know I will be blessed immensely from it!
[www.biblein90days.org](www.biblein90days.org)

Wanda (2010-06-23 03:14:09)
Amy, I recently came across someone else that was talking about the the bible in 90days as well.

## Don’t Want to Dance to My Own Tune (2010-06-16 00:15)

[1]

God often uses the least likely person to accomplish his purposes. In Acts 9:15, God sends Ananias to
commission Saul, a killer of believers, to carry the Good News of the Gospel. Like a guitar being played by
one who is unskilled, Saul was making a lot of noise being used by the Devil. However, a divine encounter
with the Master had him playing a different tune and fulfilling a far greater purpose.
Left to our own devices, we can engage in many noise making activities but be out of tune with our life’s
purpose. Surrendering to God puts us in perfect harmony with His will for our lives.

ozjane (2010-06-16 05:55:20)
reminds me of the chorus that says ”let me dance to the beat of your heart”
I had a night some weeks ago where I listened to the Cohen song Hallelujah..it is on a CD of duets and is sung
gloriously but I ended up weeping and weeping over the line that suggests that any Hallelujah will do......the sacred
and the profane....I wept and wept for the blindness of our world.

One Heart (2010-06-16 08:37:46)
Beautiful Wanda. This really ”pulls the strings” of my heart. ;) Our 20 year old son is blessed to be gifted in music. I
saw it since he was a baby and dedicated it for God’s glory. He is now 20. He plays every instrument without lessons
although years back we took him for formal lessons for a few years. He served in praise and worship ministries, but
is not using his gifts for the Lord at this time–well, not the gift of music but others yes. This reminded me how he’s
a bit out of tune right now, BUT I KNOW IN WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED!!!
Lovely WFW sis.

Missie (2010-06-16 08:49:25)
Beautiful WFW and great reminder to not just ”make noise!”

Sherry @ Lamp Unto My Feet (2010-06-16 09:43:11)

A beautiful graphic for the verse. May I always be an instrument in perfect harmony that He can use.

SnoWhite {Finding Joy in My Kitchen} (2010-06-16 11:04:06)
thanks for sharing that – so often the world wants us to ”march to our own drum” and be ”independent”! However, as
you’ve written, truly, our goal is to be in the band with God allowing Him to use us to make a beautiful symphony.

From the Heart (2010-06-16 16:19:39)
Yes, a great scripture and picture - to be in harmony with God. I’m reading Rick Warren’s Purpose Filled Life, a 40
day devotional book, along with my oldest daughter. Today’s devotion taught me how to have God as a friend. It
was the most amazing experience I’ve had in a while.
I tried what Rick wrote and it works.
Thanks for sharing and visiting my blog as well.

Joan (2010-06-16 18:45:00)
Ooohhh this is so good. I’m reminded of the verse in 1 Corinthians about a clanging cymbal. Used in the right way,
the cymbal enriches music. By itself, and without the right rhythm, it is annoying.
Have a blessed day!

## God of the Detours (2010-06-17 11:52)

Being a bit directionally challenged (as I like to call it), I like to take a familiar route. And on the occasions
that I’m venturing off into a new city, I refuse to leave home without driving directions from Yahoo maps.
Unfortunately, I don’t have GPS yet so written instructions to and from is a must! Even with directions
there has been times when I missed a turned, sending me into a state of utter panic. Had one such episode
this past weekend. Although I’ve learned to be a bit more relaxed when I’ve suddenly found myself off the
intended route, it still causes me to grip the steering wheel tightly with apprehension. All the while looking
for something that looks just a wee bit familiar. Last week one of my dear cousins shared an experience she
had while driving in a note entitled, God of the Detours, that spoke to the part of me that longs to cling to
the familiar way. With her permission, I’m sharing it with you today.

```
I think I had an” AH HA” Prophetic Moment while driving en route to the radio station.
Every Wednesday I go to the radio station to record a broadcast and I always go one particular
way. It’s a longer route, however I don’t mind the extra minutes driving because it gives me a
chance to relax, reflect and regain me in those moments of solitude.
This morning with music blaring and me singing to the top of my lungs, ”There’s Nobody Like
You Lord”. I ’m driving my way when suddenly I found myself in the midst of orange cones,
workmen, machinery, detour signs and construction. My way was blocked, it was being recon-
structed! Needless to say I was very displeased but in the midst of my ughs and omg’s, I had
to make a decision to either stay barricaded in a lock down position, that would keep me at a
standstill and miss the recording or I could venture on the detour roads and see where they led.
Anyone that knows me knows that when it comes to driving I’m a one way kinda girl, so with
apprehension in my throat I followed the one detour sign and immediately felt out of place on
this unfamiliar road in this unfamiliar neighborhood and it was in that moment that I heard the
Spirit of God say:
This is symbolic of you and so many of many children when it comes to your relationship with

DETOUR SIGNS AND IT KEEPS ME BLOCKED, BARRICADED AND LOCKED FROM
RELEASING THE BLESSING. BECAUSE YOU STILL TRAVELING ON A ROAD THAT’S

Can I tell you that not only did I arrive at the radio station, my destination, but I arrived:

Whatever DETOUR you’re on right now, don’t despise it, IT just may be your ROAD OF

Thanks for sharing; this provides comfort. We all have detours in life; it is a great way to refocus and see it as sign
to slow down and
persist onward!
I had this kind of thing happen, last week, driving to Yorktown. We have a GPS, fell off and I’m slowing down.
Meanwhile, the car behind me is flashing me warning lights. He wanted to pass, but someone had sped up in the
other lane. Then he floors it and goes around me, next thing I know so does another car, with a woman, age around
```

80. Huh?! I was stunned...no one was going the speed limit; crazy! You are not alone in the direction, road blocked
world :-D

Karen (2010-06-17 17:06:29)
I loved this analogy! Written directions and a GPS can sometimes give the wrong information...and we become
lost...much like our spiritual life...we can only stay on track if we follow the infallible Word of God....

Mike (2010-06-18 19:08:04)
So relevant to me at the moment as I am trying to work on listening to the Holy Spirit. Sometimes He says some

but He is always right!

## Access Granted... (2010-06-22 07:30)

Those two words were the first thoughts embedded in my mind when I awoke Sunday morning. Access
granted&the phrase was not just a passing thought but words that seem only to become more vivid in my
spirit throughout the day. Because I learning to capture my thoughts (not just the negative ones but even
those that God speaks), I jotted it down in my journal and went about getting ready for Sunday morning
service. While driving to church, I heard within me that I really didn’t understand fully what the significance
of those two words meant. So of course I questioned, Lord what do you mean? When access is granted, it
means that places you couldn’t previously gain entrance into are now open. He reminded me that some areas
or arenas have been straightly shut up and they remain closed despite the amount of physical effort exerted.
And even regardless of the amount of time spent in spiritual exercise. I know that statement might be a
little controversial but that’s what my Father revealed to me. Am I saying that things like prayer, fasting,
or reading the Word don’t work? Absolutely not! Those exercises discipline us and get us in proper position
for when the door is opened. But until God chooses to open the door, it remains shut.

Even as I was sitting in the sanctuary, He began to continue the discourse by adding an object lesson. My
attention was drawn to a door that was partially opened. From my seat I could see a small part of the
room contents but the largest portion was not viewable. The door was not only unlocked but it was opened
partially but in order to partake of the rooms contents I would have to choose to walk through the door.
Had the door been locked I couldn’t have accessed it contents because I do not possess the key to unlock.

Access granted provides the ability to get some things done where previously you hadn’t been able to do so.
The American Heritage dictionary defines access is the a means of approaching, entering, exiting or making
use of or the right to to approach, enter, exit, or make use of. Grant means to consent to the fulfillment of
or to accord as a favor, prerogative, or privilege. In essence those two words were announcing to me that
I’ve been given consent or privilege to enter, exit or make use of some things or places that I hadn’t been
allowed to previously.

Those two words were inescapable all day. Even as I took Bella outside to potty, the clouds began to illustrate
the point even further. A darker gray cloud was positioned in front of brighter white but in a certain place
there was a window of space in the gray cloud allowing one to see the brighter cloud behind it. However, as
the gray cloud moved along the window of opportunity to see the brighter cloud became smaller and smaller

to all access was gone. The bright white cloud still existed but I could no longer see it because the Creator
had closed up access to it.

Perhaps He was reminding me that access granted doesn’t last forever. While I don’t fully understand what
it is that is being opened up for me to enter, exit or make use of, my prayer is that I don’t miss it. May He
grant me a spirit of wisdom, knowledge, and revelation. When the door is made plain to me, Lord please
give me the courage to enter in. In Jesus name Amen

hi Wanda:)
what do you say you and i make a little prayer pact
between us? that comment you left in my blog wasn’t just a ”coincidence.” leastways i don’t think so. for me it was
a confirmation from Him. it also means it to me that it isn’t my idea....but His. this one has questions too. so lets
pray for one another for His spirit of revelation. what do you think about this?
```

```
Wanda (2010-06-23 00:13:23)
Thanks, Yvonne, Pet, and Amy.
Bluebutterfly great scripture reference.
Bud, your post was confirmation to me as well. Sounds like a good idea my friend.

Wanda, this is such a spirit-stirring post. I’m filled with anticipation. Now I too shall seek His revelation. Praying
with you my sister–for revelation, clarity, and the wisdom on how to handle it once the direction is made clear. You
are right about an open door signifying an entrance OR and exit. Praying.

## Cant Afford to Trash it (2010-06-23 00:00)

[1]
So do not throw away your confidence, it will be richly rewarded. Hebrews 10:35 NIV

Paper, plastic, computers, old furniture, cell phones, food scraps, and even unused medicines are just of few
of the many things that find its way to dumpsters daily. According to the EPA, Americans discarded 250
MILLION tons of trash in 2008. Each of us contributing about 4.5 pounds of trash daily.
Whew, I knew paper had a way of accumulating around my home and office but those statistics are surprising.
From the looks of the piles of paper around here, its time for me to buckle down and do a thorough purging.
Some things I hang onto way too long. Beyond the paper, there are times I have to consciously throw out
stinky thinking, complaining, and clear out useless activities from my daily routine.
At times the stresses of life and work pile up so high threatening to smother out my hope and expectation.
However, Hebrews reminds me to keep a firm grasp of my confidence in God.
Do not, therefore, fling away your fearless confidence, for it carries a great and glorious compensation of
reward. Hebrews 10:35 (AMP)

GlowinGirl (2010-06-23 04:01:22)
How true! We need to hang on tightly to our confidence in Christ, and make sure we throw away the things in life
that harm our walk with Him.

Mylene (2010-06-23 04:03:44)
Good traits are easier to throw away but the bad ones are easier to keep.
A very good reminder.

ceemee (2010-06-23 05:12:58)
This is true, oftentimes we replace confidence in God with lots of worries and negative thinking. it needs to be the
other way around.

Great word. ”...there are times I have to consciously throw out stinky thinking, complaining, and clear out useless
activities from my daily routine.” So very true. We must check ourselves continuously–or better yet, have Him examine
our hearts to purge all that is not of Him.
Lovely WFW.

Thanks Susan, God bless you.
Thanks for visiting Cathy. God bless & keep you is my prayer.
Joatta, I enjoyed your WFW post.
Mylene, that’s interesting way to look it.
Bluebutterfly, certainly keeping our eyes focused Him helps us withstand. I then think He places scriptures like this
b/c He knows our human tendency to want to throw in the tile.
Lori, we must ever remind ourselves of His goodness when we’re in the trenches of life.
Thank you, Joanne. Hope you’re doing well.
Andrea, God bless you. He’s so faithful to send us just what we need.
Crystal,Sherry I appreciate you stopping by.
Bev, heads & hearts. I like it.
Linda, no better place for your confidence to be.
Missie, His words has the right prescription in times of doubt. Having some ”go to” scriptures is always good.
Natalie, no surprise we’re on the same page. For there is one Lord, one Spirit. I’ll have to check out your posts. It’s
always interesting to see how God reveals things to others.
Thanks, Lisa & Partialemptynester, Beth, Bernice Appreciate you stopping by. God bless you.
Bud, sorry didn’t mean to step on toes :)
Debra & Denise, WFW has been such a blessing as I go across visiting blogs I get so many reminders.
One Heart, yes only He can fully examine us. We’re more likely to give ourselves a pass.
Cemee...you’re so right
Glowngirl, very wise words for us all you’ve shared.

Ozjane (2010-06-24 21:07:47)

## Recyclable You (2010-06-28 13:30)

[1]

Although, I don’t watch it as often as I once did, HGTV is a favorite of mine. It’s a great place to get ideas
to spice up your living environment. Of particular interest to me are the shows that seek out flea market
finds and then turn those items into something impressive. After they’ve finished dressing them up a bit,
they no longer look like rejects suited for the garbage dumpster. Instead they look like new, store bought
items deemed for a place of honor.

Most times they have to do some cosmetic work on the items. Stripping them of paint, sanding, cutting,
painting and polishing are all required before the transformation is complete. Not unlike ourselves, who
require some remodeling before we’re ready to enter the spotlight of our God given roles. He has to strip
away the painting from our old selves. You’ll find that it’s necessary for Him to do a pit of sanding as well.
Sanding causes irritation. Do you find yourself being a bit irritable? Could it be that God is sanding to
expose some areas that need to be addressed in your life?

For most of the furniture, sanding is required in order to allow the new paint to stick. The new ideas,
mindset, and instructions He wants to give us will be unable to adhere without Him getting in there and
scuffing up the old. I believe God wants to paint new anointings, new assignments, new connections, new
creativity, and new ingenuity into our lives but we must endure the complete makeover. No skipping steps
allowed. If we walk out only after the stripping or sanding has been done, we leave ourselves vulnerable to
our enemy. Trying to skip past to the painting and polishing may make us appear ready but in the end the
old stuff-our way of thinking and behaving-show through.

Lord, I don’t always find the stripping, sanding, painting and polishing to be comfortable. But help to
remain humble and submitted to you as you complete your perfect work.

Want to join the fun? [3]Heres how:
Grab your current read
Open to a random page
Share two (2) teaser sentences from somewhere on that page
BE CAREFUL NOT TO INCLUDE SPOILERS! (make sure that what you share doesnt give too much
away! You dont want to ruin the book for others!)
Share the title and author, too, so that other TT participants can add the book to their TBR Lists if they
like your teasers!
P.S. Well I didnt quite play by the rules. I havent actually started reading this book but its next on my
list. Ive been waiting a while to read this one.
Whats next up on your to be read list?

## Whatcha Got Cookin? (2010-06-30 00:00)

[1]

And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, Hebrews 10:24

We all are presented with opportunities daily to stir up strife, murmuring, complaining, or gossip. And even
if were not the instigator ourselves, the temptation to mix in with others stirring up these troubles can be
easy to slip into. However, Hebrews calls us to a greater task of stirring up love and good works in one
another.

What have you been stirring up lately?

Stop by the [2]Internet Cafe for more Word Filled Wednesday.

Well, unfortunately – today I might be stirring up controversy. Not intentionally, but anytime I mention my political

Anyway – great scripture to keep ever before our hearts sweet Wanda.
Now I’m wondering if I should remove my blog post.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-06-30 06:21:15)

One Heart (2010-06-30 08:43:01)
Great words. I’m glad I see the question today and not two weeks ago. So, today I’m stirring up mercy, grace,
forgiveness, fellowship, kindness and more than anything else, love. Yet, I remiind all of us that even when we do stir
up trouble, He’s using it all to make us more in His image and the greatest lessons are learned in our mistakes. So for
those who may not be stirring up the right things today I say, be glad you stopped by here and received a reminder
```

and a boost, but don’t condemn yourself. Get up and go love again and thank Him for His grace.
Thank you for sharing my friend.

AnooCre8ion (2010-06-30 08:47:11)
Great word Wanda. thank you for by and your prayers for my family would be most welcome as we are facing some
trying times. blessings to you

Blessings Wanda! This is so creative!!! Great image with the verse! I love your header for this beautiful blog as well
(added you in my new WFW bookmarks).
So thankful that I’m not stirring up any of those... but more love & good works (but that seems prideful and I want
none of that either).
Have a wonderful Word Filled Week!
Thanks for your visit to our team blog: The Lighthouse of Prayer.
Peggy

Donna (2010-06-30 10:25:14)
Great image and a timely reminder for all of us. What am I stirring up today? Sometime like others have said, I stir
up controversy by my words on politics and America. It is my desire to always stir up love and encouragement.
Blessings to you!

Susan (2010-06-30 11:42:23)
Oh wow, this was just precious!!
I pray I’m always stirring up something that brings glory and honor to my KING!!!

## 1.5 July

## Nobody Likes Me (2010-07-02 06:30)

Nobody likes me, everybody hates me. Think Ill go eat worms!
Those are the lines of a childrens nursery rhyme or song my younger sister would sing when she wasnt
getting her way or she felt like she was being left out. The other day I was reading a passage in Psalm where
David was expressing similar sentiments.

```
I look for someone to come and help me but no one gives me a passing thought!
```

```
No one will help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me.
```

```
Then I pray to you, O Lord. I say, You are my place of refuge.
```

```
You are all I really want in life.
```

```
Psalm 142:4-5
```

There has been times Ive felt alone and its comforting to know that even King David, a man after Gods
own heart found himself in the same position. Live long enough and youre bound to find yourself
disappointed by another human. (Not to mention how we disappoint others) Somebody, some where didnt
show up at some time or in some way you expected but there is One who is always available.

```
Youre never alone or without help!
```

necessary to remind myself that I serve a God who is ever present.

## Freedom (2010-07-03 14:09)

[1] Wishing each of you a safe 4th of July
weekend.
Now for a lil [2]Linky Love

• Still looking for some creative ideas for your celebration?
– [3]Not Just a Mommy has some inspiring treat ideas
– Visit [4]Frost Me for additional party ideas.
• If unforgiveness has you chained, why not set yourself free? Ann Voskamps article entitled [5]The
Work of All Children: How to Forgive Our Parents, offers some practical advice.
• Im certainly glad to live in a free country and grateful to those who work to protect our freedom but
lets ensure were placing our trust in the proper place. See Lindas [6]Where Do You Place Your Trust?

BTW, Thanks and welcome to all my new blog followers! Ill be stopping by your blog homes soon. Im so
grateful for all of you that continue to peep in from time to time. May God continue to bless and keep you.
I leave you with a few quotes on freedom.

```
It is by the goodness of God that, in this country, we have three benefits: freedom of speech,
freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.- [7]Mark Twain
```

```
Real freedom is creative, proactive, and will take me into new territories. I am not free if my
freedom is predicated on reacting to my past.- [8]Kenny Loggins
```

```
Most people do not really want freedom, because freedom involves responsibility, and most
people are frightened of responsibility. - [9]Sigmund Freud
```

```
Freedom is a muscle... you have to exercise it.- [10]Roy Scheider

## Becoming A Woman Who Loves (2010-07-06 08:18)

L. O. V. E.  four simple letters yet what does it really mean? In a time when love is used casually to
describe our fondness for the latest fad, hairstyle, book, car, food, phone or cd, does the word love carry
much weight today?

If youve been around church for any length of time, youve heard the love chapter-1 Corinthians 13. Verses
4-7 describe love as patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its
own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but
rejoices when truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through
every circumstance. In the past, I tended to cringe a bit every time I heard those verses because my love
seems to fall utterly short.

[1]
[2]In Cynthia Healds Becoming a Woman Who Loves, she dissects this mysterious organism called love and
leads us into discovering that its possible to reproduce this God quality specimen. The book is an 11-week
study that can be tackled alone or as part of a group. It is divided into eleven chapters titled-Supremacy of
Love, A New Commandment, The Source of Love, Bearing Fruit, The Character of Love, Loving the Saints,
Love in Action, Love Forgives, Love Reconciles, Loving Words, and Love Never Fails.
Each chapter starts with a brief introduction, a scripture, and quotation from a Christian writer. I like
that Ms Heald does not attempt tell the reader what this love is but guides readers into discovering it
for themselves through Scripture. Only after the readers self-discovery does the author share her personal
reflections. Chapters conclude by urging the reader to seek God for specific life application. The small size
of the book makes it easy to pack in your purse or bag and it contains ample space for writing responses to
questions.
After completing this study, I walked away with a fresh perspective on love and how it weaves its way into
every area of our lives impacting our walk with Christ, relationships, and ministry endeavors. No longer did
this Christ-like love seem like an elusive, dangling carrot but as natural by-product birth from intimacy with
the Lord. According to the authors bio, Cynthia Heald, has written numerous Bible studies, although this
was my first time reading any of her work. I would definitely recommend this study for anyone looking to
learn more about Christ-like love.

Thanks for the review, Wanda. Love is ”the greatest of these” for a reason.

NavPressGal (2010-07-06 15:01:53)
Thanks for the lovely review. I am so glad you enjoyed this study. Cynthia Heald has an entire series called Becoming
a Woman Who... I hope you can explore them, too.

Loving biblically or as Christ loved is so hard to do. Thanks be unto God that His Spirit enables us.

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-07-06 20:37:28)
I’m always looking for another good bible study. Thank you for this review.
```

```
Wanda (2010-07-06 23:43:51)
You’re right Blue. Christ left an awesome example of what true love looks like. I pray that I grow to reflect it more
and more as I get to know Him.
Other studies from Cynthia Heald will definitely be on my to be read lists, NavPressGal
Gregg, I agree that it is hard b/c it goes against our natural tendencies, which is the way of the Kingdom. But it is
possible b/c of the Holy Spirit.
Wisdomvirtueandrubies, I think you would find this study enlightening.

I haven’t heard this one before....it was good today because it tied in with the rain we are getting right now and it is
a reminder that the rivers can’t flow without the rain. So I too need to swell with the rain as the song says and then
I will have a life that flows.

## Some things are made to last (2010-07-06 23:03)

[1]
Three things will last foreverfaith, hope, and loveand the greatest of these is love. I Corinthians 13:13
NLT
But for right now, until that completeness, we have three things to do to lead us toward that consummation:
Trust steadily in God, hope unswervingly, love extravagantly. And the best of the three is love. I Corinthians
13:13(The Message)

Lord, help me to build my life on these eternal things. In Jesus name. Amen [2]

is the greatest.

Karen (2010-07-07 07:47:28)
Do you remember how Evangelist Billy Graham would say, ”God’s love is Forev-uh and Forev-uh!” Isn’t it good to
know that God’s love will never end?

## Proclamation (2010-07-08 11:15)

The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon Me, because He has anointed Me [the Anointed One, the Messiah] to preach
the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery
of sight to the blind, to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden, bruised,
crushed, and broken down by calamity], Luke 4:18 (Amplified)

God’s Spirit is on me; he’s chosen me to preach the Message of good news to the poor,
Sent me to announce pardon to prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind, To set the burdened and battered
free, to announce, ”This is God’s year to act!” Luke 4:18 (The Message)

My prayer for you is that youll see what you havent been able to see. Im praying that where youve been
lame (emotionally & spiritually) there will be mobility. Lame-Places you couldnt perceive walking out of,
walking through, walking in or getting over. That youll walk in freedom in those places that youve been
constricted. That TODAY youll experience a new level of deliverance. In Jesus name

## No longer the same (2010-07-11 14:04)

I woke up in the same house but in a new place. Everything is new now. Nobody but you Lord can make
the old be new again. I thank you for the realigning. Thank you for new perspective. For new mobility and
for a fresh wind of your spirit. God, there is none like you. To you be all glory, dominion, and power forever!

## No Death Today: Resuscitate Instead (2010-07-12 17:43)

[1]
Have you ever felt like what you were doing wasnt working? Ever contemplated throwing in the towel or
withdrawing your name from the race? If not, I sure have. Life is full of ups and downs. For me, last week
just happened to be one of those down times. Although there was nothing that occurred out of the ordinary,
it was the ordinary itself that seemed to sap my strength.
During a time of fellowship with the Father this weekend, I was instructed to strengthen what remains.

Blinded by the mundane, I couldnt see any remaining parts. As I pondered, I was reminded that God
always leaves His people with a remnant. Though it may be small, the leftover was enough to get things
done with God. Consider Nehemiah and the rebuilding of the wall for an example. His enemies thought
it foolish to use the rubble to erect the wall and even if he managed to get it standing again, it certainly
couldnt withstand any opposing force.
Like Nehemiah, I was challenged to strengthen the remaining rubble of my faith, hope, love, prayer, and
worship. As small as it might be, it was time to fortify it. But, how you ask? Two simple ways:

1. **Put God****s Word on it.** An increase in my Bible consumption and application enlarges my spiritual
fortitude.
2. **Exercise it more.** Anything you dont use atrophies.

Weve been given some weapons by our Commander-in-Chief but even they, like a knife that becomes dull
after extended use, require strengthening at times. Our use of the Word of God has to be sharpened to allow
for more precision in our lives. Lets not forget about our armor. Like clothing stretched out of shape over
time, our armor can have too much slack in it making us more vulnerable to the enemys attacks. Tighten
up your belt of truth! Readjust your helmet of salvation! Pull up the laces on your shoes of the gospel of
peace. Move your breastplate back into position! Lift up your shield of faith and sharpen sword! Dont get
slack in clothing yourself daily with EVERY piece of the armor of God.
Having donned the proper attire with weapons in hand, we can begin picking up the rubble-[2]

broken fragments. [3]Breakdowns happen in life either through
wearing out over a period of time or by sudden brute force. **Has there been a chronic problem or sit-**
**uation that has caused a rift in your faith, hope, love, prayer, or worship?** Or, maybe it was
something unexpected-sickness, job loss, infidelity or betrayal-that is threatening to murder your trust. Re-
gardless of the reason for your brokenness or weariness, its vital that you strengthen what remains. God
hasnt asked us to do anything with what was lost but only the remaining part. Perhaps your faith love,
prayer, and worship are all intact. _But are there some spirit led activities or ministries that you started out_
_strong, full of passion but the lack of participation or expected results has caused your commitment to wane?_
If God hasnt called you to stop a thing, your assignment now is to fortify it.
Revelation 3:2 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not
found thy works perfect before God.
**Are there some areas in your life that you need to strengthen? If so, refuse to let it die!**
Father God, I thank you for your loving kindness. Only because of your great mercy were not consumed.
Thank you for giving me an ear to hear you and now that youve given instructions help me to obey. Forgive
me for becoming so distracted by what was not that I neglected what remains. Today, I refocus my eyes
upon you. For you are my help, my salvation, my redeemer, the lifter of my head, and my exceedingly great
reward! In Jesus name, Amen.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-07-13 12:56:17)
Wanda, how true. When you said ”just the ordinary itself” I could feel myself going back to yesterday. I was listening
to a piece on the life of Harvey Pekar and what struck me was his desire to let everyone know that there was nothing
”ordinary” about them.
We all have things in common (we’re all created by God), yet we also are each uniquely uncommon...vessels fit to be
used for His purpose.
Everybody’s like everybody else, and everybody’s different from everybody else. - Harvey Pekar
I celebrate the EXTRAordinary you, Wanda.

The Handmaid of the Lord (2010-07-13 15:03:07)
Hi Wanda: I do enjoy reading the Bible every day, preferably in the morning, before I come in contact with people.
Lol. This good habit has helped strenghten me in times when throwing in the towel seems to be very desirable.
Receive peaceful today.

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-07-13 15:39:30)
Girl, I’m really wondering how you made it into my head and managed to see what I’ve been going through. What
an AWESOME word of encouragement! I needed this more than you know. This is one I’ll save for later, when I may
need another dose. Thank you for allowing the Spirit of the Lord to use you.

Karen (2010-07-14 00:44:33)
_”God hasn__t asked us to do anything with what was lost but only the remaining part.”_...I needed to read this to-
day...thank you for being obedient....

Wanda (2010-07-14 03:09:54)
@ **Bluebutterfly**, you’ll never know how much those words watered my soul, my dear friend. Your kindness is greatly
appreciated.
@**The Handmaiden**, Morning times is my favorite too. Getting our dose of the Word helps us to be better prepared
for the day ahead.
@**Wisdomvirtueandrubies**, you mean I’m not the only thinking like that :) Actually I’ve read/heard several re-
minders lately that I’m not the only one going through such. Only the Father knew what you needed and I’m honored
that He used me as the vessel.
@**Karen**,Thank you. Lately I’d been too focused on what was missing/lost. Thanks to God for realigning my focus.
May your eyes be firmly set upon Him.

Wanda (2010-07-14 16:50:32)
Isn’t that such a wonderful verse. It just stuck in my mind when I came across that passage of scripture in my reading
a few days ago. @ **Bobbi**, the frig would be a could place for that lovely reminder :). @**Ozjane**, I’ll have have to
check out your broom post.@**Mike**, He’s used that broom to clear us a path to him. I don’t think I’m going to look
at my broom the same any more.
Thanks everyone for stopping by. I enjoy seeing everyone’s WFW posts. They are so encouraging.

Karen (2010-07-14 17:15:09)

I love that He sweeps it all away. Great verse!! And thank you for visiting and commenting on my blog today. :) I
love how He had you in the passage from Romans just the day before. He is so amazing in how connects people and
His Word. Hope you have a blessed day!!

partialemptynester (2010-07-14 18:39:26)
Love it! I’m with Valerie,I want this in my kitchen...and with Bobbi, great one for the fridgetator...and with you, I
don’t ever WANT to look at my broom the same way (I’ll forever LOVE the idea of Him sweeping my sin away as I
sweep the dog hairs outta my kitchen...gross...just another way of looking at sin: it just don’t belong!)

Bev (2010-07-14 18:47:22)
i love this wanda!!

jo.attalife (2010-07-14 19:33:27)
Wanda, this is so true and and the picture is perfect for it. How easy it is to just admit sin and rest in His cleansing
and forgiveness, and yet so many do the opposite and try to hide instead.

This is something to thank God, for paying the price to set us free from the bondage of sin. Praise God for His love.

## Lost & Found (2010-07-20 05:30)

[1] Do you ever loose your keys? It seems Im always in search of mine. My
family tells me I should tie them around my neck. Even my purse seems to enjoy playing tricks on me by
swallowing up my keys. And my niece and nephews still poke fun about the time we were in Memphis and
I was going berserk about my keys when I was actually holding them in my hand. Yep, my hand-imagine
that. Searching for something you know youve lost is very different from discovering a thing you werent
even aware youd managed to loose in the first place.

Recently I read 2 Kings 22-23. While cleaning up the temple a priceless treasure was discovered-Gods Word.

It seemed a little odd to me that finding the Word of God in His Temple would be something unexpected.
Upon reading the Words, King Josiah learned that his nation had been living against the Lords command.
The Kings actions gave me some key principles when finding something I might have lost thats valuable.

1. Dont just stick a label on it and place it on the shelf again: After finding this treasure, the king didnt
simply store it in an unforgettable place.
2. Use what you found: His discovery moved him to action-first he read it. Had it read to the people.
3. Clear out the clutter: He removed distractions by tearing down the idols in the land so that he and
the people would be more inclined to focus on this rediscovered treasure.
4. Seek Gods direction: He sought Godly godly counsel.

Have you ever lost something and forgot you ever had it? I have and Im not just referring to tangible stuff.
In some ways, I lost who I was. Things I once adored no longer even crept into my mind. I forgot that I ever
had a passion for it. However, a couple weeks ago, after hosting a youth recognition day, my sister made a
statement-youre coming back to your old self. It was just a statement made in passing but some how it
stuck with me. The event struck up some old creativity and passion that I had long forgotten existed and
cease to use. But, as I was focusing on the scripture passages, I gleaned some application for right were I
am. Isnt that what the Bible is for anyway?

Now that the spark was reignited, its my job to keep the flames a burning. Not tuck it in a cute little box
as a memorial but to put it to use as much as possible.
Have you tucked away some gifting, talent, revelation, dream or inspiration? Perhaps its time you dust away
the cobwebs and let the wind of the spirit blow on it again.
Lord, forgive me for neglecting to tend to and realize the value of the treasure youve given to me. Now that
Ive rediscovered it, Lord, show me what your plan is for it. And teach me how to use it so that it might
bring you glory. In Jesus name. Amen.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-07-20 06:27:51)
It’s one thing to lose a set of keys, but another when one loses their direction in life, many the time I have thought
hey what am I doing here and why.
Common sense soons returns but I hope I don’t lose my way too often.
Yvonne,

I so have, thank you for the reminder that it is a gift I need to use!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-07-20 12:55:01)
Amen! It is one thing to have something in the deep for protection, but it quite another when it’s buried so deep that
the purpose is never realized.
Keep ignited, Wanda!

Joanne Sher (2010-07-20 13:26:20)
SO powerful, sweetie. Great stuff to remember.

Will Burke (2010-07-20 14:38:17)

Lisa (2010-07-20 20:14:43)
Those passages about Josiah finding the covenant were my Bible reading yesterday. It felt so good to see one of the
Kings coming back to God. Great post Sis. I’m glad you’re coming back to who you are in Him. Praise God.

**Yvonne**, you’re right there’s a difference b/w the two but the results are the same...I’m not able to go anywhere
really :)
Thanks, **Karen**
**Missie**, pick it back up again dear.
**Bluebutterfly**, I love that thought. There is a time when things are to hidden/buried to allow for proper germination.
Thank you,**Joanne**.
**Will** just may be time to strike up a tune for your girls :)
**Lisa**, no matter how bleak things look. He always leaves a remnant who will turn back to Him.
**Lee**, indeed

elaine @ peace for the journey (2010-07-21 01:14:27)
Hey Wanda... thanks for stopping by the blog and leaving a comment.
I adore this teaching, and ”yes”... there have been seasons in my life (a recent one comes to mind) when I’ve lost a
bit of myself in the process of my life. I’ve been so overwhelmed by our recent move and, at times, have felt great
discouragement. I’m rallying now, but it’s been a hard climb upward.
Like Josiah, I need to keep the Word in front of me to serve as a constant reminder and encouragement regarding the
holy life I’ve been called to.
peace elaine

Faith Imagined (2010-07-21 01:36:17)
Thank you for such a wonderfully honest post! I have done this too many times to count! Thankfully God keeps tabs
on our treasures and lets us know when we lose are forget them!

One Heart (2010-07-21 01:53:38)
Wanda, it looks like there’s a lot of cleaning going on today. ;) I love it.
Yes, it most certainly is up to us to fan the flames. Staying connected to the body is definitely one way to keep the
flame going. You know that old story of the coals burning together but if you take one out and set it apart by itself

```
it simply stops burning.
Loved this post.

## A Little Out = A Little Back (2010-07-20 23:00)

Then He said to them, Pay attention to what you hear. By the measure you use, it will be measured and
added to you. Mark 4:24 (HCSB)
And He said to them, Be careful what you are hearing. The measure [of thought and study] you give [to the
truth you hear] will be the measure [of virtue and knowledge] that comes back to you–and more [besides]
will be given to you who hear. Marked 4:24 (Amplified)

When I read this verse I always think of weighing scales... somehow, I never made the connection with a tape measure,
and to think I use it often. LOL. Wanda, you just opened up my eyes to a new picture, girl!

Beth in NC (2010-07-21 03:42:31)

Thank you, Cathy, Yvonne,Kaye.
Appreciate you drop by Amanda and Donna.
Jo.attalife and Beth, I actually had a different scripture in mine related to comparison at first but this scripture stood
out to me instead. I enjoy WFW because it brings me fresh insight to scripture.

ozjane (2010-07-21 06:54:28)

Hope that is not an Aussie expression.
It really helps the words to go slap bang whack....cop this and obey.

Great word! May we give graciously and wholeheartedly not holding anything back. Happy WFW!

## A Lil Something Sweet (2010-07-25 03:23)

[1] Pulled this baby out of the oven a little bit ago. Nothing quite
like a fresh peach cobbler. Mmm mmm can you smell it? Oh taste and see if its good. Now since you all
cant pull up a chair and dig in, Im whipping up a lil something sweet for you next week.
Just six short months ago, I decided to naively jump out into the deep ocean of blog land and I never could
of imagined that each of you would have joined me in this journey. This month Ive reached two milestones
here at the The Watered Soul: 1.) posted my 100th post and 2.)had my 100th fellow water seeker join the

site. Hooray! Im so grateful for every line of encouragement you gave, every trip to the blog you made and
even just seeing your faces among the followers. It just brightens my day and youre in my prayers. You
make things around here a little bit sweeter. So be sure to stop by next week for a lil celebration. Hope
youre enjoying a restful weekend.

## Teaser Tuesday {Six-Liter Club} (2010-07-27 08:00)

[1]

```
The scene was all too typical-a madhouse of activity with crying children, sleeping drunks,
and a crowd of brothers standing at the foot of a stretcher holding a white-haired matriarch
struggling to get her breath. The sweet-sour smell of bloody vomit and clinical antiseptic mingled
as a familiar odor and prompted me to quicken my pace. pg. 55 Six-Liter Club by Harry Kraus
```

[2]

[3]
Teaser Tuesday is a book meme hosted by [4]Should Be Reading.
**My Review**
Harry Kraus _Six-Liter Club_ is the latest book Ive read this year. I was lucky enough to win this book via
Kats blog [5]Heart to Heart. It is one of the best books Ive read this year. Kraus weaves a tale of suspense,
romance, self rediscovery, ambition, and faith in this medical thriller. Camille, an orphan, has worked hard
to excel in academics and has become the first African American woman trauma surgeon at the Medical
College of Virginia. Everything seems to be falling into place-a new position, a promising new love interest
and a new member of the distinguished six-liter club. Amid the male dominated surgical culture, Camille
feels the pressure to conform to the good old boys way of doing things, while being compelled to set her
on own mark. At the height of her success, memories from her childhood in the Conga begin to haunt her
threatening to ruin everything shes worked so hard to achieve.
Anxiously anticipating what would happen next, I found myself staying up late into the night reading. As I
came to the end of the book, I lingered on the pages sadden that the novel was coming to a close. This was
my first time reading any of the authors work and I was well pleased. I highly recommend this book-it will
not disappoint.
Whats the latest page-turner youve read?

## The Power of a Song & Praise (2010-07-27 23:00)

[1]

2 Chronicles 20:22 At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the Lord caused the armies of
Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves.

As I read through by daily Bible reading, this particular passage of scripture stood out to me. King Je-
hoshaphat and the people of Judah were facing war with a mighty enemy. The Word of the Lord to them was
that they would not have to fight but take their positions; stand still and watch the Lords victory. Although
fighting was not required of them, they did have to show up to the battle. I was impressed by the way they
went out to the battle. Not with complaining or fear but with singing and praise. At the very moment they
decided to sing and praise, the Lord moved.

Reading this made me begin to ponder about my own attitude when facing battle in my life. I dont always
have a prophet speaking words of victory to me like Judah did but I do have Gods Word that proclaims He
gives me overwhelming victory. Yet even knowing and reading His Words, there are times I cringe, hide and
complain rather than taking my position courageously with a song on my lips and praise in my heart. How
many times have I limited his ability to move because I was in the wrong place and posture of heart?

jo.attalife (2010-07-27 23:29:05)
Ah, Wanda, I can totally relate! Sometimes I do stuff [1]like this with a totally ’clean conscience’ until God’s Word
comes in and reveals what’s really going on inside. At other times, I obey while kicking and screaming (which really
isn’t obedience, is it?). But God is faithful in meeting me where I am. Sometimes He requires us to stand, to sit, or
otherwise be still. May we always do so with the right posture of the heart.

Amanda (2010-07-28 00:24:56)
I think we all relate to this post! If only the pressure wasn’t so great sometimes! LOL no excuses though... His word is
Truth and if it says to sing and praise, then that is what will give us the victory! Then we can get off that mountain,
before facing the next... but at least we would be moving forward!

One Heart (2010-07-28 06:02:37)
Awesome post. That is one of my favorite passages in Scripture. Remember that we ourselves can speak that Word
and ”prophesy” even unto ourselves through the Holy Spirit living in us. Prophesy to yourself woman of God!! Take
your position ”courageously.” I’m not surprised you used that word. Come check my WFW which I posted before
coming here. Is that prophetic or what? That’s the Spirit of the living God living in us and His Word is alive!! Love
you my sister.

That was beautiful! You ask a very thought provoking question - ”How many times have I limited his ability to move
because I was in the wrong place and posture of heart?” Thanks for reminding us about the power of praise. As One
Heart said, we can prophesy to ourselves and take our position courageously! Thanks for sharing!
Blessings to you today!

Joanne Sher (2010-07-28 07:51:25)
oooh yeah. Wonderful reminder. Happy WFW, my friend.

Peggy (2010-07-28 08:35:32)
Blessings Wanda! GREAT WORD!!! and so very true when we face the battle!
There is such power in PRAISE!!!
Glory! Hallelujah! Thank you for this great reminder and good WORD to ponder and recall!
I love the question that you ended with for us to respond:
How many times have I limited HIS ability to move because I was in the wrong place and posture of heart?
...too often, (forgive me Lord)
Thanks Wanda for this WFW and your precious visit to mine! Always a pleasure... going into my day
PRAISING the LORD & facing those battles in PRAISE!!!

ozjane (2010-07-28 08:51:13)
This links up with what has been so much on my heart and that is thanking God for the answer the moment we finish
asking.
And rejoicing in His sovereignty, His good plans for us, that if we ask for things only if they are His will for us.....He
will answer immediately.....and we do not need to know what the answer is to be thankful and rejoice.

Wanda,
This WAS fantastic... You really drove it home with this question...

”How many times have I limited his ability to move because I was in the wrong place and posture of heart?”
Praising at all times...praising and worshiping and rejoicing regardless of the circumstances. What thoughts you
shared with me today. Thank you!
blessings,

GlowinGirl (2010-07-28 10:52:00)
You said this so well. Isn’t it funny how you can read a scripture and it speak so clearly?
”At that very moment”... I struggle with rejoicing during the battle. It is often later that I can pause and see how
God led me, and then I praise. It is the very praise itself that can turn things in our favor.
Great thought today, Wanda!

Bobbi (2010-07-28 11:05:38)

Thank you so much for sharing WFW with us!! His Word is so great & touching every fiber of my being today! You
make me wonder too, how many times have I limited His ability to move because I thought I had to fight... being in
the wrong place & having a heart not postured within Him - within me. WHOO! He teaches so much through meme.
Hugs & Prayers, HL

## Overwhelming Victory (2010-07-29 12:03)

Just wanted to share a scripture God brought to mind today before I head out to work.
Can anything ever separate us from Christs love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or
calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? No, despite all
these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us. Romans 8:35,37 (NLT)
Im sure its probably a familiar scripture but while I walked this morning and pondered on some things in
my life, He reminded me that no matter where I am, He is there also. Dont let the events of our lives skew
your view of Christs love for you.

## Yes, You Matter to Me (2010-07-31 04:56)

My sweet blogger friend [1]One Heart, has been hosting a meme this week and I finally took the time to write
up my post. She asked us to tell about how blogging has enhanced our lives in some way. Many assume that
what they do here in blog-land has little significance (me included). I cant even recall what triggered my
desire and facilitated my courage to actually start a blog but when I did, I only thought it would be for my
own eyes. I couldnt fathom that anyone would actually be interested in reading my thoughts as I struggle
along in my journey with Jesus.

Yet, in this journey, Ive met so many other members of the body of Christ that have encouraged me,
strengthened me, reproved me, and brought me laughter as Ive read their blog posts. Their words were
often confirmation to me and at other times comforting to know that Im not alone. At other times, I found
their posts answered unvoiced questions of mine. For fear of missing someone, I will not begin calling names

but every time Ive visited your little corner of the blogosphere, youve enhanced my life. Having you stop
by mine refreshes me as well because I realize that theres many other things you could do with your time.

So I take great delight in honoring you for all that you do. God has given each us the ability to do certain
things well. And whether your blog is laced with humor, truth, daily living, encouragement, tips or a mixture
of many things, do it with all Hes given you.

Have a great weekend. One Heart, I squeezed this in before the clock turned midnight for me :)

Wanda, you are most definitely right, the blog-hop was set up until the end of today–Sat, 7/31. For some reason,
I got the numbers mixed and thought yesterday was the 31st. So guess what, you get a book too!!!! I love it–more
opportunities to bless. Love you sis!!!!
Okay, now the link is officially closed. hahahahahaha =D
Will be in touch via email.

Will Burke (2010-07-31 19:17:02)
I’m sorry that I missed the meme. It’s amazing that we live in an age where we can have ”un-met” friends from around
the globe, like pen-pals, with no delay! An age where anyone with access to a computer can influence countless people
across borders and cultures!

## Infused with Power (2010-08-02 11:44)

Wow&isnt that really awesome when you ponder on it!

9-11But if God himself has taken up residence in your life, you can hardly be thinking more of yourself than
of him. Anyone, of course, who has not welcomed this invisible but clearly present God, the Spirit of Christ,
won’t know what we’re talking about. But for you who welcome him, in whom he dwellseven though you
still experience all the limitations of sinyou yourself experience life on God’s terms. It stands to reason,
doesn’t it, that if the alive-and-present God who raised Jesus from the dead moves into your life, he’ll do
the same thing in you that he did in Jesus, bringing you alive to himself? When God lives and breathes in
you (and he does, as surely as he did in Jesus), you are delivered from that dead life. With his Spirit living
in you, your body will be as alive as Christ’s!

12-14So don’t you see that we don’t owe this old do-it-yourself life one red cent. There’s nothing in it for us,
nothing at all. The best thing to do is give it a decent burial and get on with your new life. God’s Spirit
beckons. There are things to do and places to go!
15-17This resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It’s adventurously
expectant, greeting God with a childlike ”What’s next, Papa?” God’s Spirit touches our spirits and confirms
who we really are. We know who he is, and we know who we are: Father and children. And we know we
are going to get what’s coming to usan unbelievable inheritance! We go through exactly what Christ goes
through. If we go through the hard times with him, then we’re certainly going to go through the good times
with him! (Message)

## Keeping Watch of the Time (2010-08-03 23:00)

[1]
But make sure that you don’t get so absorbed and exhausted in taking care of all your day-by-day obligations
that you lose track of the time and doze off, oblivious to God. The night is about over, dawn is about to
break. Be up and awake to what God is doing! God is putting the finishing touches on the salvation work he
began when we first believed. We can’t afford to waste a minute, must not squander these precious daylight
hours in frivolity and indulgence, in sleeping around and dissipation, in bickering and grabbing everything
in sight. Get out of bed and get dressed! Don’t loiter and linger, waiting until the very last minute. Dress
yourselves in Christ, and be up and about! Romans 13:11-14 (The Message)
Its something about having another birthday roll around that makes me more cognizant of the passing of
time. It seems like it was just a few days ago when I longed for the freedom of adulthood. Along with new
liberties, adulthood ushered in new responsibilities. As Ive gone about the business of living, its been easy
to get caught up in the have-to(s) of life and lose focus of the essential.
Lord, as I celebrate another year of life today help me to be alert and sensitive to you. Show me how to
make the most of my days. Let me not spend my time in trivial pursuits. Dont let me miss what you are
doing God.

## Is It Time For a Makeover? (2010-08-07 09:40)

Im not sure if its just a girl thing or what but every now and then I get the urge for something different.
A few weeks ago I had the bright idea to rearrange my living room. However, it seems that my new couch

and love seat are little heavier than my old one. So, I decided it best not to try dragging it alone. But, I
was not to be deterred from getting a new look in the living room. So whats a girl to do without an extra
set of hands? Well, I decided to rearrange some of my accessories like pictures, floral arrangements, small
tables, etc. And, the simple rearrangement of old items made the space feel new again.
As I careen the blogosphere, I get the hankering to redo my own blog. Well, I dont always have the extra
set of hands or expertise to do a full redesign on my own. Or the desire to splurge on getting my own
professionally designed custom blog because I sort like tinkering with HTML code. So whats a blogger to
do? Find a virtual set of extra hands. There are tons of sites that offer free tips and tutorials on enhancing
your blog. Using some of these virtual hands, Ive been able to display my replies to your comments in a
different color, change my blog header image, change my rss feed to feedburner and add subscription by
email. And, those are just a few of things Ive learned since blogging.

Are you still stuck using the original blogger templates? Good news! You dont have to be. Several sites
offer unique templates to give your blog a fresh new look. I decided to share of few of the sites that Ive
found helpful.

Blogger templates or backgrounds

• [1]All Blog Tools
• [2]Blog Skins
• [3]Adori Graphics
• [4]Theme Craft

For tips and tutorials stop by these virtual hands:

• [5]Sneaky Mama Blog Design
• [6]Beautiful Blog Designs
• [7]The Cutest Blog on the Block
• [8]Mamas Losin It

Next time you get the urge for a lil something different on your blog, these are definitely some tools you
can use and they are great for newbie bloggers like me. Hope you have a fantastic weekend and dont forget
today is your last day to sign up for the fabulous giveaway by CSN stores [9]here.

hi Wanda,
i just did a total makeover in 3 blogs. it was/is fun and the blogs are still getting tweaked:) one blog is a total
makeover with out visible followers(pictures) although i can read a number on my dashboard. just don’t know the
names....and no comments. it’s just an all out writing blog. no bells and no whistles:) i love it already!!!
```

```
Ellie (2010-08-07 21:23:00)
Thanks for the links! I like to change it up, too! It looks great, by the way I hope you are happy with your living
room. I find if I decorate in similar color palette, I can rotate items from room to room to give it a new look. Pillows,
candles, and plants can also change it up quick!
```

Continuing to keep you in my prayers.

Wanda (2010-08-08 19:32:02)
Glad you guys found some of them useful. I know you veteran bloggers probably were already familiar with some of
those. Bud, I noticed your redesign the other day. It looks nice.
@Ellie, yes I’m enjoying the subtle changes I made in the living room. I like your idea of decorating in the same color
palette. Wish I had thought of that when I first moved into my place.
@Lisa, I understand dear. You’ve added some extra to your plate. I’m doing well and appreciate your prayers very
much my friend.
@Yvonne, I have a test blog I play around on before making any changes to the site but luckily I haven’t been told it
was going to be deleted. Always appreciate you stopping by.

[1] Are there any unfinished projects lying around your house? Or what about unachieved dreams stashed away in the recesses of your heart? If youre anything like me, youve at least once started a project with great zeal and enthusiasm only to have the incomplete pieces stashed away in a closet.

Well you and I are not the only ones, who have ever done such. In, Ezra 4:25-6:22, we find the Temple of God in Jerusalem still incomplete and all work has ceased on this ordained and worthy project. The rebuilding had been ordained by God and commissioned by King Cyrus but it encountered some interference and opposition that halted all progress.

[^24]: That put a stop to the work on The Temple of God in Jerusalem. Nothing more was done until the second
year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
1-2Meanwhile the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo were preaching to the Jews in Judah and
Jerusalem in the authority of the God of Israel who ruled them. And so Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and
Jeshua son of Jozadak started again, rebuilding The Temple of God in Jerusalem. The prophets of God were
right there helping them. Ezra 4:24-5:2
After hearing the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesy, Zerrubbabel and Jeshua were moved to action and they started again to rebuild the Temple of God. Nope, this wasnt the first time they had made the decision to obey the voice of God. They did it before and failed but something about what the prophets said (the Bible doesnt even go into the specifics of what the prophets said) stirred up their faith enough to begin the work again. When faced with starting something again,the fear of failing again tends to immobilize me. But these men were moved from their inactive state to one of purposeful activity. All by hearing two men speak. Which leads me to believe that at times God uses people to spur us back into action. You might not be prophesying but something you shared in a blog post or conversation shared among associates can be a word spoken in season for someone else that moves them from an inactive state.
Did they meet some opposition after deciding to begin again? YES. Will you or I meet some opposition/interference when we choose to begin again? YES, we will. Opposition or interference is often wrapped up in the subtle sayings of others questioning if this is something you really should be undertaking. At other times opposition is clothed in the soft whispers of our voice that speaks doubt. The good news is that neither has to stop us from finishing the project. Further reading in Ezra, shows that the exact people who were coming to bring distraction from the building were the same people who were commanded by King Darius to ensure that the people of Judah had everything they needed to complete the rebuilding.
Whether its been 2 days, 2 months or 2 years since you first started your quest to build your temple or dream, you can simply start again.

@ JBR, yes He’s been reminding me that everyday is another opportunity for a fresh start.

LaughingLady (2010-08-12 16:40:47)
This is great encouragement! The hubby and I were just talking last night about now neither of us has enough am-
bition to finish things and achieve goals once it becomes obvious that some serious time and effort will be necessary.
There are COUNTLESS things we say we’d like to do and we start some of them but so often, because we know
ourselves well, we don’t even bother starting because we suspect we won’t finish.
This is good advice. Must revisit this discussion with the man, armed with this view from The Word!

Monica Watkins (2010-08-14 15:59:34)
I am so behind with my reading, but I’ve been saving the posts in my email to read later. I’m trying to play catch
up, & I found that this post was indeed timely. I am in that ”begin again” place. Not always the easiest thing to do,
but it is truly a faith exercise. Thank you for the encouragement.

## He Holds The Future {Word-Filled Wednesday} (2010-08-10 23:01)

[1]

I came across this passage of scripture during my daily reading yesterday. It along with vs.14 just seemed
to jump out and grab me.

But I am trusting you, O Lord, saying, You are my God! My future is in your hands. Psalms 31:14-15a
(NLT)
Life is fragile just like the precious flower this hand holds. Once that little bloom was attached to a stem,
which had some roots supplying its nutrients. Yet something or someone came along and snatch this precious
bloom from the place it once thrived.
At times my life seems to be like that little flower, one moment Im blossoming in my planted place of
comfort. Only to be uprooted by unexpected storms or changes in life. It is at those times that I can not
see or understand why God allow these things to be. The darkness of the storm seems to shroud His hand
from me.
Yet even in those times, I must remain confident that He indeed is God and my future is secure in His hands.

fragrant flower we need to BE & STAY connected to our Source that feeds us and gives us His Living Water...even
His own life for ours! I can so relate to your analogy to our own lives. My life certainly seems like that too! Thanks

Suz (2010-08-11 23:08:35)
Hello Wanda, glad I found your blogpost today. I have been reflecting upon the spiritual dynamics of giving and
receiving – as they are so connected.
The images of the Father giving his Son and of Christ holding on to nothing provide us with profound examples

```
of giving. But, you point also to entrusting all things to his hands. Letting go - opening our hands - is not just
abandoning the things we’ve held but it is entrusting these things to His care.
Thank you!
```

```
Just Be Real (2010-08-12 02:52:46)

Thank you for these wise words, and for stopping by my blog the other day.

for our every need.

## Even When I Dont Do Right (2010-08-16 07:01)

Only you Lord no my innermost being. Its you that knows my uprising and my down setting. You know
the true motives of my heart. Nothing I do is concealed from you. Sometimes, its my desire to do the right
thing but choose to do the wrong thing instead. And, others time I stubbornly insist on doing things my own
way. Even then you dont choose to cast me away. Im so thankful that you dont abandon me or consider
me as utterly hopeless. But, you keep on showing up with your love, your compassion, your kindness your
forgiveness.
Just as you did for the Israelites, youve been doing for me. Not just when you wooed me to follow you
but from my mothers womb, I received your provision, your protection, your instruction. Although I didnt
always recognize it was you, who was sustaining me. It was you that kept redeeming from the hands of my
enemies. I say THANK YOU Lord!
May others come to know you. For you are a God of forgiveness, gracious, and merciful, slow to become
angry, and rich in unfailing love. May we your body honestly proclaim that we dont always do it right and
its only because of your great mercy that we are not consumed. May those who have yet to accept you as
Lord and Savior come to see that despite what theyve done wrong, are doing wrong, or will do wrong that
youve already been lavishing them with your love. And that you stand ready to forgive. In Jesus name,
Amen.
[^17]: They refused to obey and did not remember the miracles you had done for them. Instead, they became
stubborn and appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery in Egypt! But you are a God of
forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to become angry, and rich in unfailing love. You did not abandon
them,[^18] even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, This is your god who brought you out of
Egypt! They committed terrible blasphemies.
[^19]: But in your great mercy you did not abandon them to die in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud still led
them forward by day, and the pillar of fire showed them the way through the night.[^20] You sent your good
Spirit to instruct them, and you did not stop giving them manna from heaven or water for their thirst.[^21]
For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear
out, and their feet did not swell! Nehemiah 9:17-21 (NLT)

Beautiful truth in your post. Even when we don’t feel worth of His love, we are. I remember believing that I must

those same thoughts out there in our world & I can only hope that somehow, some way, they are reached. =)

at times:-)! I enjoy reading your blog. I’m signed up. Have a fruitful day!!!

Tea with Tiffany (2010-08-17 13:23:40)
Wanda, I love your heart. Amen. I too feel like I don’t do right because of stubbornness.
I love this line ”But, you keep on showing up with your love, your compassion, your kindness your forgiveness.”
That’s our great God. He is so much more than we can imagine. Thank you, Jesus.
And thank you, Wanda, for jumping in with a personal and powerful prayer and adding the verse that lines up with
your prayers.
God bless you. I hope you will join me again this weekend, starting Friday.
I’ve been behind this weekend because of my daughter’s 13th party and back to school shopping. Should be better

Have a glorious week in HIM. You’re covered with love and grace.

## Worth the Wait {Word Filled Wednesday} (2010-08-17 23:01)

[1]

The Lord is wonderfully good to those who wait for him and seek him. Lamentations 3:25
Now I must admit, I hate to wait. Hate waiting behind slower traffic. Hate waiting in line at Wal-mart
especially when theres thousands of check-out counters but no one operating them. Hate waiting at doctors
offices and hair salons. WAIT is a 4-letter word that just tends to rub me the wrong way. For some reason,
I assume my time could be better spent doing something else.
Unfortunately for me (or I should say fortunately for me, I guess) the God, who holds the universe together,
expects me to do just that-WAIT. Unlike the times I have waited for someone or something that failed to
arrive, He promises that my waiting will not be in vain.
Did you notice that little 3-letter word and? Its rather odd how something so small can have such
significance. My waiting for Him is supposed to be accompanied with some action. We cant get away with
just the passing of months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes but we must fill the moments with seeking.

WAITING 4 HIM + WORK 2 SEEK HIM = WONDERFUL GOODNESS

Am I just marking time as it goes by or am I actively seeking Him as I wait?

treat!

I love this.

Christian (2010-08-17 23:17:39)
hahahaha...Great thing Wanda! Maybe God wanted to tell us the same thing!
Waiting for Him is really excititng. U never know what comes next. U’ll just be surprised.
God bless you sister! I keep on praying for you!

Amanda (2010-08-17 23:26:17)
I dislike waiting too... immensely! One of the first lessons the Lord had to teach me was patience. He has good
reasons for making us wait sometimes, for answered prayer, dreams to eventuate, a new season to tick over. Waiting
stretches us to trust in Him.
Wonderful post Wanda... Bless you!

Kaye Swain for the Sandwich Generation (2010-08-17 23:33:26)
Thank you for an encouraging post with this inspirational Bible verse. I definitely need to work on my waiting -
especially with chocolate! Tho right now, it’s more the ice cream. :) Have a blessed week.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-08-18 00:01:54)
Wonderful post Wanda, waiting can be a tiresome thing at times, all depends on what we’re wating for,
Enjoyed the read.
Yvonne.

ozjane (2010-08-18 00:37:28)
I am sure we are meant to use these waiting times for intercession. There are people around us. I wonder if anyone
has ever prayed that the Holy Spirit would convict them of sin, righteousness and judgment.....we have a wonderful
opportunity to maybe be the one person who has ever prayed for some of those people around us as we wait.....for
the person on the end of the phone, for those in the other cars. Traffic lights are my call to pray.....it has mad a
difference....I have a long way to go but God always and only waits to bless us.

Nicole (2010-08-18 05:44:05)
Great post!! Love it!

Shannon Jacobyansky (2010-08-18 05:44:56)
I love your post! A wonderful read! We need to seek Him in everything we do...even when we are waiting in a line at
Walmart! Thanks for writing...oh...I love your picture on your header...very peaceful!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-08-18 07:26:00)
Never in vain, Wanda, and it’s even better when God throws in some chocolates.

GlowinGirl (2010-08-18 07:38:50)
What a great point! Our waiting isn’t passive – it’s looking for Him in a seemingly stagnant situation. I’m not a good
waiter either, Wanda. So, I guess God is teaching us together! :)

LisaShaw (2010-08-18 07:40:41)
Oh well said!!!
Love the WORD and photo!

Missie (2010-08-18 08:08:42)
Argh! So true, I am SO impatient with the Lord!

Peggy (2010-08-18 08:46:40)
Blessings Wanda... I’m seeking Him!
Love how you shared the WORD and the delicious photo!
I’m not too good at this WAIT either.(sigh)Thanks for tying this all together. I gotta hurry up and wait! It’s double
the time down here in Mexico... always a long wait and then start over and wait again. Think God is trying to tell
us something!
I’m so thankful that waiting on the Lord is connected to His promises and His promises are true and ohhh
so good! (kinda like the dark chocolate)! Thanks Wanda...enJOY!

Sisters Of Honor (2010-08-18 09:45:16)
Thank you for sharing this word. I look forward to reading more of your blog.

Joanne Sher (2010-08-18 10:34:08)
This is fabulous, Wanda! Waiting is NOT passive - and I needed this reminder. LOVE the pic too!

A great WFW Thank God for His gift of patience.

Donna (2010-08-18 13:56:35)

This post was for me as this week has been filled with unexpected waiting. It’s a ”wait” I simply don’t understand,
but I must trust that the Father sees what I do not. I’ll continue to seek Him as I wait.

Laurie (2010-08-18 15:14:34)
Oh, this is goooood! I love the ”wait + work” equation, and the verse with the photo are a perfect match! This has
blessed me tofay.

From the Heart (2010-08-18 16:43:43)
Thanks for your comment on my blog. That scripture was so fitting with me right now. My cousin’s son died this
week and she’s having a really hard time with it. Hopefully the autopsy will tell them what happened.
I like your verse and I don’t like to wait either, but I’m reminded of the scripture ”they that wait upon the Lord shall
reunion their strength”; so there’s a promise from God for waiting.
Blessings, AE

Karen (2010-08-18 18:12:45)
I totally enjoyed this, Wanda...
The graphic was awesome and your reflections on waiting blessed me....

Amydeanne (2010-08-18 18:34:15)
when you put it like that!!! lol I love the visual! happy WFW!

Lisa (2010-08-18 21:57:51)
Wonderful message. Let’s wait for Him AND seek Him!

arlee bird (2010-08-19 00:02:40)
If I know I’m going to have to wait like for an appointment or something I will usually take a book to read. Sometimes
I’m so engrossed in my reading I want the wait to last longer.
We don’t usually just jump into a career or position in life we have to receive an education or pay our dues, which
amounts to having to wait.
We must wait on God so we are ready for Him. We have so much preparation that we must do in order to be what
we need to be.

Sherry @ Lamp Unto My Feet (2010-08-19 03:52:35)
Awesome word today! :D
They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run
and not grow weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me, Lord, to wait!

Wanda (2010-08-19 06:01:31)
Glad to know I’m not the only impatient one among us. But, you’re all right waiting is beneficial for our character
and spiritual growth.**@ Christian** Yes, it looks like we needed the same message. After finishing up and scheduling
my post, I received confirmation from reading your WFW post. Love it when He does that sort of thing. ;) I was **@**
**Ozjane** I thank you for the bit of correction. You’ve helped me to see the many opportunities I’ve missed to be a
blessing to others through prayer. Just goes to show why we need the whole body of Christ to keep us well-grounded
and see what we’ve been blinded to. **@ Beth**, I’ll be sure to check out your regular blog when I get a moment.
Appreciate the invitation. **@ From the Heart**, I pray that God would strengthen and comfort your family during
this time and that truth will be revealed regarding the cause of death. **@ Arlee**, you bring up a good point as well.
In the wait is preparation for all areas of our lives. I like to take reading material with me to appointments, too.
But never so absorbed that I’m not secretly wishing they’d hurry up...lol. Especially since if I show up too late my
appointment is cancelled but they don’t mind me waiting. **@ Everyone** that stop by. I appreciate you visiting and
pray that God would strengthen us all as we seek and wait on Him. Hope you a blessed rest of the week!

From the Heart (2010-08-19 07:41:49)
Thanks for your prayers.
Blessings, AE

Sometimes I get caught up in everyday life...like waiting in lines and becoming angry that I don’t have time to get all

But, then I read your blog and take a breath- and remember that God is in control. And I need to talk to him ASAP.
Thanks for the reminder that life is good.

## No More Cave Dwelling (2010-08-20 07:15)

[1] Where have you made your dwelling place? No, Im not
referring to your physical address. Instead I inquire about the place your mind, your soul, your will chooses
to make its abode. After reading a post my blogger friend, Mike, shared over at This I do entitled [2]What
Is Your Cave?, it had me pondering over cave dwelling. Not sure if this happens to you but there are some
posts that I read and then there are others that seem to read me. Its the ones that read me that Im unable
shake from the recesses of my mind. They refused to be ignored clinging and begging me to explore more.

Isolation and darkness push to the forefront of my mind when I hear the word cave. At first glance it doesnt
sound like a very pleasant place to reside. However, as an introvert, its in the aloneness of my day that Im
fully able to recharge. In the darkness of the night, my body finds the necessary rest to face the dawn of a
new day. If the cave can serve as a place of peace and restoration, why would dwelling in one be a problem?

The place you draw away to gain perspective or protection can also be the place you use as a means of
avoidance. Avoiding dealing with conflict, relationships, troubles, and trials. Just check out Gideon and the
other Israelites in Judges 6, who had made caves for themselves in attempt to hide from their oppressors,
the Midianites. These Midianites were no joke; they came in and reeked utter havoc.

Despite all the trouble they were causing, Gideon wasnt encouraged to stay tucked safely inside the cave. It

seems that[3] while he was waiting around looking for God to do

something about the situation, God was looking to him to render aide to the people. To me, a cave dweller
would be the least likely person to send out to battle. But, what do I know really?
Just as the angel commissioned Gideon to come out of hiding and go out to face the enemy, there are some
battles that we cant afford to ignore. Too much is at stake. Not just us but our families. Not just our
families but our communities. Not just our communities but our nation.
Ive got some more chewing to do on this one. While I do, I encourage you to check out the post over at
[4]Mikes blog.

Bud Ezekiel (2010-08-20 10:17:20)
OUCH!!!:)
well sister....this is a timely reminder and a CONFIRMATION as to the direction i must go. i’ve been HIDING out
in a cave. the very same day, i began my blog was also the very same day my childhood friend and brother (in
arms-nam) as well as in Spirit gave a sermon about Gideon ”hiding out.” i’ve had the bunker mentality for too long
and the good Lord is nudging me to get moving again. to get back into the race. although i’m physically limited there
is an UNLIMITED re-Source to accomplish what needs to be done. it’s a new and different trail for me. i’m going to
link to this post later today sis:) thank you for the confirmation.

```
PatriciaW (2010-08-20 14:01:04)
There are days when the cave is useful, when we need to get away and recharge, as you said. But I’m more and more
mindful of the cave of my mind, where I hide away mentally even while busy with tasks and in the midst of a crowd
of people. Where I go when things are just too difficult to deal with. That’s the cave that I’m trying to steer clear of.
```

```
One Heart (2010-08-20 16:48:34)
”The place you draw away to gain perspective or protection can also be the place you use as a means of avoidance.”
Ugghh...so true. Everything in seasons too because there is much gained when God hides us for seasons, but sooner
or later we must come out with what we’ve gained there.
This strengthens me today. Much needed during a week of battles which are attempting to isolate me yet again.
My dear sister, your book is on the way. It should either have today’s postmark or tomorrow’s. Sorry again for the
delay–I had a tougher week than the last. Enjoy it and let me know when you receive it. Blessings!

Toia (2010-08-20 17:46:24)
Awesome word!!! This will make a great bible study. Thanks for sharing!!! It’s definitely an eye opener. Have a bless
weekend!!! I’m on my way to Mike’s blog =D
PS - Thanks for commenting on my WFW post!!! :)

arlee bird (2010-08-20 17:59:41)
I used to enjoy spelunking, which is cave exploring. I liked the cool darkness on a hot summer day and the year-round
same temperature environment. The cave was a retreat where it was quiet and peaceful and nobody could see you.
I stopped spelunking when I started to have an uneasy claustrophobia about being there. What if I got stuck in a
small passage? What if it caved in on me? What if my light went out and I couldn’t see?
I doubt whether I would ever go spelunking again, but I’d like to have a house built over the mouth of a cave that
had no bats living in it.

Too much is at stake. I hear you. Thank you for sharing, now time to visit the caveman LOL. :)

Monica (2010-08-20 21:26:15)
”No more cave dwelling...” Good word. I think I’ve been pushing myself out of the cave these days, but sometimes i
just want to stop. I don’t want to push myself anymore. But i know i must come out. We must realize we’re needed
on the outside.

Just Be Real (2010-08-20 21:53:54)
I have been hearing lately the topic of hiding. Both positive and negative. Great post Wanda. Look forward to what
the Lord lays on your heart to post here. Blessings.

Karen (2010-08-21 02:44:35)
Amen...awesome word...I will think on this for a while tonight, I am sure....

Wanda (2010-08-21 03:06:34)
Oh Bud, didn’t mean to step on your toes, my friend. It’s the message He’s feeding me. The types of caves we reside
in look different based upon our own life but if we stay there past the point of healing, restoration, and protection, it
results in hiding.
No worries about the book, One Heart. How can a unexpected gift arrive too late. I’ll let you know when I get. I
love gifts and especially books ;)
Toia, wish you a blessed weekend too.
Needed on the outside...I like that Monica and you’re definitely moving my friend. I’m in awe of the faith moves
you’ve made.
JBR, hiding can be either good or bad depends on where God has designated to be.
Thanks, Karen, Sarah, and Tiffany.
Yvonne, that sounds like a splendid place to rest.
Arlee, I’ve learned a new word tonight ;)
Patricia, you’re so right we can be physical out among others but still be in hiding.

## A Heart Full of Sweet Ps (2010-08-21 13:30)

[1]
As I join in with [2]Tea with Tiffany for Sweet Ps and the others who come to bring you our ps, I pause to
say thank you Lord. Thanks not just for what youve done but for who you are. The more I come to know of
you, the more I long to know. Im not satisfied with old clichÈs or second-hand testimonies. Ive got to know
you for myself. I long to see you in fresh new ways. Break every box and shatter every illusion that limits by
ability to see you. Destroy every bondage and chain that keeps me bound to old ways of thinking, believing,
and being. Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit in me. Dont let me walk in deception and
keep me from all evil.
Father, I thank you for the unexpected P(s ) youve brought into my life. I never knew that when I started
jotting down my thoughts in this blog a few short months ago, that my path would cross so many people. I
thank you for how youve used them to sharpen me, shape me, shake-me up, strengthen me, and enlighten
me. Just as theyve been like refreshing water to me, send people along their paths that will speak a word
in season to them.
I dont know their struggles, trials, or concerns but you do Lord. And, I come looking to you and asking
that youd strengthen them where theyre weak. That youd be their compass, Lord as they walk along the
paths of their lives. May you send abundant water to quench their thirst and moisten their parched fields.
I thank you for raining on parched relationships, careers, ministries, and homes. Thank you for reviving,
replenishing, and reconnecting.
Thank you for the prodigal sons and daughters that youre sending home now, God! We thank you for
turning hearts. Thank you that even as they walk out their madness, Lord, youre right alongside watching
and protecting them. If they make their bed in hell youre there and if they ascend to highest mountain,
youre their also. Even when we cant find them physically, they are never unreachable to you. If your love
and kindness drew us up and out, we know you can do the same for them. We choose to rest in the fact
that you are Lord and their future is safe in your hands. I love you so much Lord and I give your name the
praise. In Jesus name, Amen.
Do you have any Sweet Ps {prayers, petition, or praise } to share? Feel free to leave them in the comments
(you may send them to me privately by clicking on the contact me page) or write your own post and link
up. Wising you a blessed weekend.

realized that you had left me a comment on my Granola Bar Devotional!! So...it seems our meeting was ”no accident!”
I especially liked this part of your prayer - and may I join you in saying, ”Lord, strengthen me where I am weak. Be

my compass, as I walk along the path of my life. Send me abundant water to quench my thirst.”
I am pleased to follow you, Wanda - and I love the way you sign out - THIRSTY FOR HIM...me, too!
BLESSINGS!

## Son or Slave? {Monday Manna} (2010-08-23 13:01)

[1]

Today, Im linking up with Joanne at [2]An Open Book for Monday Manna, which offers fellow bloggers the
opportunity to share their thoughts, insights, poems, or devotionals that relate to a specific verse posted at
her blog. The verse we were asked to chew on was Galatians 4:6-7.

And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, Abba,
Father! Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
Galatians 4:6-7 NKJ

As I thought on this verse a couple of things came to mind. (1) The difference in motivation of servitude
between a son and a slave. A slave serves because he is obligated to do so but a son serves a Father out of
love and respect. (2) The difference in benefits/wages between the two. A slave is often paid less than what
he actually deserves but certainly he only earns wages for the work he has actually done. If no work, no
wages. However, a son is able to reap some rewards/benefits from his father simply because of the nature
of their relationship. As a child of God, I can never do enough or be good enough to earn all of the many
benefits that God has made available to His children. I need not try to earn my salvation but just accept
the wonderful gift.

Have you been busy serving on committees and involved in various religious programs in an attempt to
prove your worthiness of salvation or that you are good Christian? To be actively involved in Christian
service is admirable and is something I believe that we should do. But what motivates you to serve? If its
anything other than love and obedience to the Father, perhaps youre serving from a slave mentality.

What does that verse speak to you?

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-08-23 18:54:26)
Thanks, Wanda. I often ask myself, when I have the opportunity to do something ”good”, whether I am really doing
it unto God. Am I doing it in love, joy and peace, so that the name of God will be glorified. I’ve learned to back away
from the things where I know that my zeal and my motivation for doing them really is not unto God’s glory.

Lisa (2010-08-23 23:40:47)
It’s truly overwhelming if we allow our minds to bask in the knowledge that we are sons and daughters of THE MOST
HIGH GOD! What a privilege. I only wish more would accept this fact and come into their sonship.
Thanks for a great post to start the week Ms. Wanda. I hope the rest of your week is blessed beyond measure!

Amanda (2010-08-24 09:10:59)
What wonderful insights you have shared Wanda.
Sometimes it is uncomprehendable, that what God longs to give us, bestow on us, is a FREE gift! That is the life
and life more abundant of His Son Jesus. Salvation. Deliverance. Healing. And so much more... a free gift, because
we are the sons (yep, us sisters are sons lol), of the eternal, living God.
I think that is why people struggle so much to not try to earn their salvation... because it is so hard to believe such a
mind-blowing gift... yet it is A GIFT!

CeCe Wilson (2010-08-26 16:29:00)
Wow, Deep thoughts my dear! I appreciate your always having something for me to think about. I’ve been faced with
this question before with my prayer life. I think that is why sometimes we don’t always get what we want or think
we need from God. Slavery may be the place of asking things from God amiss because we are coming from the wrong
frame of reference. A son can ask boldly either knowing his Father won’t refuse or if He does it is out of His wanting
our best good and timing. Slaves don’t feel they have the right to ask no matter how much they have done for the
Master and the asking is done more out of brazenness than boldness. Thanks for the mind food!

## Its All in There (2010-08-24 05:14)

Before my eyes opened or my feet hit the floor this morning, a tune was playing in my head.

```
All that you need is in the name of Jesus
```

A YouTube search was unfruitful probably because I dont really know the name of the song. Not even sure
of the other lines of the song but apparently those are the words I need to know this morning.

Lord God, I dont know what lies ahead of me this day but I thank you for the reminder that I already possess
what is needed to meet the challenges, tasks, and demands for today. I dont rely on my own giftedness,
intelligence, or fortitude but I seek your guidance and strength. Thank you for all that youve packed into
that name of Jesus. When I need peace, I can find it there. When I need strength, I can find it there. When
I need a way made, its in that name, too. When I need healing, I can find it there. Protection, provision,
salvation, and so much more are all found in the name. When I cant think of any lofty words to say, all I
need is to call that one name&.Jesus.

## I Cant Hear You (2010-08-24 23:01)

[1]

I included the NLT version of the scripture on the photo but I also like how the Message paraphrases it.

But I’m deaf and mute to it all,
ears shut, mouth shut.
I don’t hear a word they say,
don’t speak a word in response.
What I do, God, is wait for you,
wait for my Lord, my Godyou will answer! Psalms 38:13-15

There are times in life when its necessary to turn a deaf ear to enemies taunting. And, when I cant think
of any scriptures to quote or lack something positive to say, its best that I choose silence instead.
Oh and what about the times that youre praying for someones salvation and everything you see and hear
from them is contrary to your prayers. Thats a good time to make a decision to not be moved by the
happenings around you.

Peggy (2010-08-25 09:56:41)
Blessed morning to you Wanda...my, you were either up late or awake very early... because Of the time of your visit
to me, thank you!
Each time I open to the Watered Soul; first I am blessed by your beautiful header that greets me, and the wonderful
verse of Isaiah 58 then I am watered by your words and God’s wisdom through you!
You are such a wellspring!
But this one made me chuckle! It is so perfect! Thank you for sharing the NLT and The Message (it was good to
compare them). I needed this so often in my marriage and home life. Thank you for the understanding you shared.
It’s so clear what I need to do.
We all know that God gave us 2 ears & 2 eyes but only 1 mouth. Good advice you point out. It’s so easy to be
reminded of the 3 monkeys as ”see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil” but this is much better...
DON’T ALLOW THE EVIL IN and GIVE RESPONSE... NO LIE, NO ENEMY POWER.
Yep, defeated by the blood of Jesus! This is awesome. I need to learn to WAIT and trust that God will answer in His
perfect timing & way! Thanks Wanda...
EnJOY a wonderful WFW and week!
Peggy

GlowinGirl (2010-08-25 10:22:38)
Silence truly is golden at times, isn’t it? It’s wise to learn when to speak and when not to – I have a tendency to
overdo my words. I should practice that last monkey’s pose.

waiting isn’t easy. but i remember Doug Spurling’s post when he said that just as a woman must wait to give birth,
we also must wait on God. but the time can be well spent in continued prayer and supplications. thanks for the
reminder, Wanda. i’m still waiting as well...

OH MY GOODNESS, Wanda, this is PERFECT. I LOVE IT!!! I am spreading this one for sure.
Thank you for visiting and I will publicly embarrass myself yet again by letting you know that your book mailing has
been delayed yet again. UGGHHH...it’s so not like me. I tend to be a perfectionist so God is up to something here
for sure, but I am a big believer of excellence so I truly apologize. Circumstances beyond my control have delayed it
but God’s timing is perfect. I am hoping for it to be postmarked no later than tomorrow–Friday, 8/27. Very difficult
two-three last weeks but I will keep my promise. Thanks for your patience sis.

## Arise Oh Lord (2010-08-27 06:59)

Oh my such a spirit of intercession just swept through me unexpectedly. But is that not how our Lord is?
Hell show up in the most unexpected, mundane places. In the midst of my getting ready to tackle the
work day the Savior had need of me. As Pet mentions in his post [1]Burden in our spirit, there are times
when theres a burden in our spirit and we should take those before our Lord. I may not know on this side
of heaven what that burden was specifically about but He does and I thank Him for trusting me with the
assignment to pray.

Like Paul, there are times that I pray in the spirit and at other times with natural words. Today was a
day for my spiritual language. The only natural words of prayer I have today is Arise Oh Lord! Arise Oh
Lord-might not seem like much but when the Lord, the one who rules and reigns, shows up ALL of his
power, majesty, dominion, and glory arrives on the scene with Him. So may our Lord arise whenever you
need Him to show up today whether that be to a wayward child, a bare bank account, a stressful job, a
broken marriage, a body ridden with disease, or on the street corner of your neighborhood.

Arise Oh Lord!

Hi Wanda,
The soul and words of this song are perfect for my morning. I feel the glory of the LORD filling my living room.
PRAISE HIM.
I love how you shared the same things that MTJ’s prayer referred to. The range of needs are wide, aren’t they?

Thanks for your prayers.
And I often pray ”Arise” too. The sleeping church must rise.
Have an amazing God-centered day.
Peace and love,

I just wanted to stand in agreement with you today. The needs may be many but as you say, ”**I may not know on**
**this side of heaven what that burden was specifically about but He does and I thank Him for trusting**
**me with the assignment to pray.**”
Bless you for being His obedient servant.

That wave of intercession you spoke of rushed over me last night... leaves me singing and praying in the Spirit and
being so absolutely in AWE OF OUR GOD!
Thank you for sharing and for being deeply in love with our GOD who is deeply in love with us! Aww, that abiding,
unfailing LOVE!

in the way.
I don’t normally watch long you tube videos, but I was drawn to this one. I haven’t heard of these guys before, but
it really blessed me... I agree with Peggy, seeing that girl dance added a fire in my spirit. Great song and so uplifting
to my spirit.

@**Bud (aka Sojourner)**, no it wasn’t just like BANG for me. But you’re already on the right road to receiving the
gift my friend. The first thing is to have the desire. He doesn’t intrude. The more you’re opened, the more the Holy
Spirit fills you until there’s an overflow.
@**Tiffany** The needs are great but our God is even GREATER.
@**MTJ** So glad to have you stop by and thanks for the prayer of agreement.
@**Peggy** Love your sweet spirit, youre such a blessing. Youre free to praise Him?
@**Denise, Bluebutterfly, Kim** thanks for agreeing in prayer
@**Karen** appreciate all the support youve showed here. God bless you.
@**Lisa**it seems the Lord has been summoning many of children. Who knows whats on the horizon?
@**Yvonne,** I found your surprise before I read your comment here. THANKS a bunches!
@**Belinda** the pleasure was all mine. WFW is also such a blessing to stop by and see other members of the body.
@**Lily** believing with you that your joy will be restored.
@**Karen,** Wow what an awesome testimony!!!! Hes arising in unexpected places.
@**Jan** thank you for your prayers.
@**Amanda** my life hasnt been the same since I received it! Glad you were blessed by the video. Its longer than I
usually include but the song was such a blessing to me yesterday.

## Hes With Me (2010-08-30 04:00)

Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me Psalms 23:4(KJV)
Even when the way goes through Death Valley, Im not afraid when you walk at my side. Your trusty
shepherds crook makes me feel secure. Psalms 23:4 (The Message)
Lord, it seems like death/destruction is crouching at my familys door. Let not the secret plots of our enemies
prevail. Expose every snare and every trick. Give us a spirit of discernment that we may know friend from
foe. Despite the shadows we see or the whisperings we hear, we can rest securely because You are with us.

MTJ (2010-08-30 07:53:26)
Hi Wanda,
As I read this post, I thought back to my childhood days and my fear of the dark. I hated to go in the bedroom and
watch as my grandmother turned off the lights. I’m not sure what I expected to see in the shadows but I was certain
it would get me.
When I finally learned that the danger was only in my thoughts, I no longer feared the darkened bedroom.
I’m much older now and yet, there are times when I find myself fearing the imposing shadows. The Holy Spirit reminds
me of the promise of Jesus to never leave or forsake me.
I pray with you that our Lord give your family the discernment to disclose what lurks in the shadows. No matter
what lurks there, God stands ready as your shield of protection.
Blessings and peace.

## Give Me Eyes to See (2010-08-31 11:19)

[1]

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

To see You high and lifted up
Shinin’ in the light of Your glory
Pour out Your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

To see You high and lifted up
Shinin’ in the light of Your glory
Pour out Your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy

by Michael W. Smith

This is my hearts cry today, Lord. I long to see the invisible and lay hold to the intangible but some times
these natural eyes of mine block my view of You. So give me eyes and ears that I might hear and see you.

Hi Wanda,
Although I’m not familiar with this particular song, the lyrics definitely speak to me regarding the desire for an even
closer relationship with Christ.
Blessings and peace.

Thanks Joanne, Amanda, and MTJ for stopping by today. May the eyes of our understanding be flooded with light.
Oh great, sojourner. I’ve run into several people that I had no way to follow up with them, if it was something that
I didn’t want to post publicly to their blogs.

## Your Recommendation Says What? (2010-08-31 23:30)

Has anyone ever asked you to write them a letter of recommendation and you felt less than enthusiastic about
it? Well, I havent been in the exact situation but I have been called for a reference. Most people wouldnt
mind recommending someone youve worked along side and seen that they exhibit exemplary character.
But, how often do we consider and critically examine what recommendation were passing onto others. In 2
Corinthians 3:2-3 Paul reminds the believers that he had no need for written letters of recommendations to
prove the effectiveness of his ministry. They themselves were proof enough.
Many of the people that our paths crossed during the course of our day are not taking the time to read Gods
written letters found in His Word. However, you and I can be assured that theyre reading our LIFE-our
attitude, speech, and behavior. Are you giving Christ a good recommendation?

[1]

The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves. Your lives are a letter written in our hearts;
everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you. Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing
the result of our ministry among you. This letter is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God. It is carved not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts. 2 Corinthians 3:2-3(NLT)
I recommend you stop by the [2]Internet Cafe to find out what other bloggers are serving up today.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-09-01 00:34:43)
A wonderful thought provoking post Wanda, I have been asked in the past to write a letter of reccomendation but
did feel awful as it was a son of a friend of mine who I knew not to be the kind hearted person his mother was, so
I made some excuse explaining perhaps they wanted someone who was working.I felt awful but I knew he would let
people down.
Have a good day.

MTJ (2010-09-01 06:01:53)
Hi Wanda,
Thanks for sharing another thought that provokes my self-examination. It has become imperative for me to reflect
the character of Christ in my thought, speech and behavior. I want to remain consciously aware that others may only
get an opportunity to see Jesus through me; I don’t want to be an embarrassment to our Lord.
Blessings and peace.

ozjane (2010-09-01 06:27:55)
The middle verse came to mind as I read your WFW...so found it all.
I thought it was a poem not a hymn.
Must find a tune one day.
”Christ has no hands but our hands To do His work today,
He has no feet but our feet To lead men in His way;
He has no tongue but our tongues To tell men how He died,
He has no help but our help To bring them to His side.”
”We are the only Bibles The careless world will read,
We are the sinners gospel, We are the scoffers creed;
We are the Lords last message Given in deed and word,
What if the type is crooked? What if the print is blurred?”
”What if our hands are busy With other things than His?
What if our feet are walking Where sins allurement is?
What if our tongues are speaking Of things His life would spurn,
How can we hope to help Him And welcome His return?”
```

Joanne Sher (2010-09-01 07:02:43)

a sojourner (2010-09-01 09:37:07)
...i hear and understand what you’re saying here. the world perceives christians(i identify myself as a believer...not a
christian) because of what they do or don’t do. without a doubt, people look at me and judge me as a non-christian.
but that’s religeon. HE is the one that turns/transforms us to become...inside out:)

Peggy (2010-09-01 10:40:04)
Blessings Wanda... I like this correlation to a letter of recommendation! I love how you graphically chose to depict
this!
I did this verse for WFW back before I started my personal testimony ”This is My Story” and put myself as this
”letter”. May our lives reflect Jesus as you have written (or better Paul wrote to the Corinthians) and you illustrated
so well! Thank you.
Be careful little eyes what you see and be careful little ears what you hear and my, oh, my, be careful what we DO or
DON’t in the Name of Jesus!Have a blessed day!EnJOY WFW!

## 1.7 September

## Sweet Ps (2010-09-04 16:07)

Dear Lord,
How can I ever thank you enough for all youve done for me and all that you continue to do? I woke up
this morning with hands and feet that could move. Your peace surrounded me as I slept last night. Because
you are Lord and you neither sleep nor slumber, I can lay down in safety and peace. I got up to a day filled
with newness-new mercies and brand new grace. For that I say thank you, Lord. For your provision, your
protection, your providence, your salvation, your companionship, and your counsel, I say thank you Lord!
You are truly amazing! To know that the God who holds the entire universe together finds delight in me is
incomprehensible.
Im so grateful for an invitation that is always open to come unto You. If Im weary or heavy laden, You offer
me rest in exchange. You exchange my sickness for your health. I can find no greater exchange rate than
you. Who else would take something of little worth in exchange for the invaluable gifts you offer? Although
youre always getting the short end of the stick, you stand ready and willing for me to bring you my load.
When Im brokenhearted, youll bind it up and make it whole again. Thats just what I need Lord, take the
broken places in my life and put them all back together and make whole again. I cant make sense of all the
fragments but you are the Master Potter and I put them in your hands. Ive grown tired, frustrated, and
disappointed in my futile attempts to pull the pieces together. That was never the assignment you gave me
anyway. So I cease from fruitless labor today. If there be anything that I labor to do today, it is to trust you
more. I labor to know You more.

As families gather together over this Labor Day weekend, I pray that youll watch over their coming and
going and that you would protect them. We welcome your Spirit to sit down in the midst of every gathering.

Bring reconciliation and restoration to families I pray. For those who are gathering together in grief due to
loss of love ones, I ask you to comfort their hearts Lord. Be strength for them in this difficult time and may
those who are left behind that dont know you come to know you. For its not your will that any should
perish.

Let your will be done in the earth! Let your kingdom come! To you Lord be all the glory, dominion, and
power. In Jesus name. Amen.

that You would be in their midst! Thank You for doors & hearts that will be opened and comfort for those grieving!
I’m so thankful Lord, that You are our Comforter!
Bless Wanda in every favor Lord this weekend! Thank You for allowing us to listen in on her intimate prayer, thanks,
praise & petitions this day! I feel like I just woke up and she has refreshed my day with an oil of gladness. Wanda is
a wonderful letter of You!
Though I am not home for Labor day weekend, I do receive her prayer and stand with her for others! May neither of
us labor in vain. May any labor be of You and produce good fruit in Jesus’ Name...

## Centered on Truth-{Monday Manna} (2010-09-06 14:49)

Joanne at [1]An Open Book is hosting [2]Monday Manna today. The passage of scripture to reflect upon
and discuss is Ephesians 6:14-18.

Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and
having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with
all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication
for all the saints(NKJV)

These verses list parts of the armor that God has made available to every believer. Growing up in church,
I had heard these scriptures quoted often but it wasnt until a few years ago that I got a clearer picture of

how one actual goes about putting on this [3] armor. In our lives, we get
dressed daily and choose our clothing based upon our intended destination. At least thats what I do. There
are some clothes I deem unfit to wear any where but around the house. Because of good old-fashioned home
teaching and personal standards, you will not find me at the grocery store in my pajamas.

Unlike our natural garments, the armor of God is suitable to wear on every occasion. Not only is it suitable
to wear but its advantageous for us to apply it every day. Why? Because our daily destinations are filled
with opposing powers, principalities, rulers of darkness, and spiritual host of wickedness.

No matter how full our closets are our clothes just dont jump on us. We have to take the time and effort to
get dressed. As I was reading this passage, I noticed how each piece of the armor was preceded by a verb.
Verbs denote action. The armor is provided by God but the action to put it in use is required by us. Nope,
Hes not coming down to dress me or you; the garments have already been issued. If a piece is missing or not
in its proper place or good condition, its because weve neglected to see and handle it as significant piece of
our lives.

Also, I took notice of the order the pieces of armor were mentioned in the passage. It starts off with the
belt of truth buckled around our waist. Belts are what I consider as accessories, which are some of the last
things you add to make your outfit complete. Yet here we see the waist, which is the center of our body,

being address first. Could it be because our li[4] ves need to be

centered on Truth? If, I dont know the Truth-God and His Word, my life is based upon lies. Lies pervert
or twist the truth. So, if truth is not firmly buckled around the center of my life, I have a twisted sense of
righteousness called self-righteousness. My feet, more than likely, will be quick to pursue chaos rather than
spreading peace. Rather than trusting God, Ill only have faith in my ability to get things done. Because
my mind would be filled with deceptive thoughts, the words wielding from my mouth would be anything but
the Word of God. Although the belt of truth is only one part of the whole armor, it appears to me that it
is necessary in order to properly apply the rest of the pieces.

You didnt forget to put your belt of truth on today, did you?

Share your thoughts on this scripture passage in the comments or write a post on your blog and link up with

ON the armor - had definitely never thought of that necessity. Thanks so much for participating!

Marsha (2010-09-06 17:55:34)
Excellent post, Wanda! You are so right when you say all the other things we put on can only be probably applied
when we put on the belt of truth first.

## Fasten to Truth (2010-09-08 02:52)

[1]

So then, take your stand! Fasten truth around your waist like a belt. Put on God’s approval as your
breastplate. Ephesians 6:14 (GW)

Even after writing on [2]Centered on Truth for Monday Manna, Ephesians 6:14-18 has still been mulling
around in my head. Merriam-Websters dictionary defines fasten in 4 ways:

1. to attach especially by pinning, tying, or nailing
2. to fix or set steadily
3. to take a firm grip
4. to attach persistently and usually objectionably

If my life as a believer is to be [3]centered on truth, what Truth is it that I should be attached persistently,
fixed steadily, and grasping with a firm grip?
* the Truth of who Christ is
* the Truth of who I am in Christ
For the most part, I dont have great difficulty in believing who the Bible says Jesus is. Its the truths He
says about me that gives me problems. My old ways of viewing myself consistently object to these truths.
Which further points to the reason why I need to be getting dressed daily in the armor God has provided.

Thanks Sis – have a blessed day!!
```

```
MTJ (2010-09-08 05:19:32)
Hi Wanda,
This is a good addendum to the previous post. A particular scripture is beginning to resonate in my spirit:
```

”**I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the** _life_
**which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself**
**up for me.**”
This scripture is helping me understand and realize that my _identification_ with Christ becomes tangible and effective
solely to the extent that I allow the truth of Christ to operate in me.
In the past, I tried to mimic Christ or someone I preceived as _spiritual_, but eventually who I was and who I identified
with came out of me. This was exhausting and contradictory to what I wanted; _but I didn’t understand what I needed._
The _life of Christ_ is real; _Christ wants to live in the believer._ Allowing the truth of Christ (_the Word of God_) to
become meaningful in my life is the identification I so desperately sought.
Thanks for providing the additional manna sister.
Blessings and peace.

Lovely and so true..to know intellectually that He rejoices over me with singing...because that is what His word says,

But that is not what faith and truth says.

Great truth we truly need to buckle around us every day. Love the picture and the verse.

hljourney (2010-09-08 08:51:43)
Awesome - wonderful - great picture! I share with you in having a problem remembering who I am in Christ... agreeing
that I know who Christ is - the Bible shares so greatly! Keeping reminders around me:
John 15:15 I am Christ’s friend
Romans 5:1 I have been justified
Ephesians 1:5 I have been adopted as God’s child
Colossians 2:10 I am complete in Christ
Ephesians 2:10 I am God’s workmanship
!!!
Getting dressed ... with the belt of Truth wrapped tightly around my waste!
God is great in letting us know we’re not alone ... thankful for WFW to share His Word & our journey’s together!
Hugs & Prayers, HL

Mystiqua K (2010-09-08 09:29:23)
Amen Wanda! I have the same problem! I think I will meditate on this scripture today! Happy WFW!!!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-09-08 09:37:28)
Oh yes, Wanda. This past weekend was my time to really get fixed and steady, and boy, what a time. Hard, but
necessary, work.

Joanne Sher (2010-09-08 10:02:03)
Oh, Wanda - LOVE this. Super stuff. Thanks - and happy WFW

Peggy (2010-09-08 11:21:53)
Blessings Wanda...Thanks for this excellent reminder of Ephesians! This is so well depicted and than shared!
I love this part:
”...in believing who the Bible says Jesus is. Its the truths He says about me that gives me problems.”
This is why the bottom of my blog has WHO I AM in CHRIST to remind me when I think these thoughts or believe
these lies! Excellent lesson & Truth! Firmly getting a grip and fixing my eyes on His Truth! Putting on the full armor,
’cuz when I miss any parts, I find
out the hard way. Love your belt graphic!!!
EnJOY WFW!
Peggy

Chelsey (2010-09-08 12:03:21)

Hi, Wanda,
First, I want to say thank you for your continued support over the past few months. Second, I appreciate what you
had to say about Ephesians and the whole armor of God. Our pastor is preaching a series of sermons with that as his
text. It is wonderful, is it not? More later. Love, Ruby
```

```
LisaShaw (2010-09-10 09:53:47)
Amen and Amen and to your last paragraph I say, Amen again!!
Powerful sharing Wanda. Thank you for always sharing your heart in the LORD. Whenever I am able to visit I come
with the anticipation of seeing, hearing, feeling MORE of JESUS!
Love and hugs!

## Looking Unto Him (2010-09-11 11:50)

Dear God,

You are my redeemer, my healer, my rock, my security, my exceedingly great reward, and my strength. I
thank you for all the ways you continue to reveal yourself to me. For you, oh Lord, are my portion. Where
would I be without you? Thank you for drawing me back to you in times that I find myself distracted. Thank
you for your healing being manifested in my body now! You are faithful! You are omnipotent! Crowned in
glory and majesty. My Savior, I thank you for all times that you rescue me! Work on me until I look, think,
and act more like you. Help me to be a clearer reflection of you in all my ways.

Lord, I lift up those who asked for prayer this week and others who are calling on your name. Theres no
situation that theyre up against that is too hard for you. All power belongs to you. I pray that they would

put on the whole armor that youve provided for your sons and daughters so that after theyve done all the
situation requires of them, theyd be able to stand. That theyd be able to stand up under pressure, sickness,
or opposition. In the midst of turmoil give them inner tranquility. If there be anything else the situation
requires them to do, let it be made known to them. For your Word declares that youll lead us along the
right pathways for our lives.
We acknowledge that we dont know what to do but our eyes are upon you. We call to you because we trust
you will answer. Why? Because, youve answered us so many times before. Youve provided for us before.
Youve delivered us from the hands of our enemies before! Youve healed us before! Youve calmed our fears
before! Youve raised us up from desolate places before! You have redeemed us from the brink of depression
and hopelessness before! Youve strengthen, revived and replenished us before! Yes, we shall think on these
things as we wait for your salvation.

For I will sacrifice a voluntary offering you; I will praise your name, O Lord, for it is good. For you have
rescued me from my troubles and helped me to triumph over my enemies. (Psalms 54:6-7)
Guide us in your truth, and teach us; for you are the God that saves us, our hope is in you all day long
(Psalms 25:5)
Thank you Lord that today is the day of salvation! In Jesus name, Amen.

## Darkness Doesnt Last (2010-09-13 12:40)

As I walked amidst the darkness this morning, I was reminded of something the Father whispered to me a

few weeks ago. Darkness loomed that [1] morning, much like it
did today when Bella and I headed out for our walk. What He whispered was something so simple but gave
me so much comfort. Three simple words-morning always comes.
Told you it was simple. Morning always comes. I know that life is full of cycles and morning naturally comes
after the night. Yet, when going through the night seasons of my personal live, I often forget that its only
temporary. So He used the sun breaking through the darkness of the night to remind me that change does
come.

Im opening up the pages of my journal to share what I wrote down that day. Hope that someone finds
encouragement in it as I did when I wrote that day. Even now I find strength to continue walking through
the shadow of death.

```
Morning always comes. Hold on through the night. Dont faint through the night season
because morning always comes. Just as when the season changes there are times when the day
is filled with more darkness than light, so are our lives. But, morning always comes. You have
to see me through the eyes of the spirit at those times. Im always shining but darkness (which I
allow) covers my presence but Im always with you. Thats why you have to build up your spirit
man so that during those seasons youve stored up a supply of my light (His Word) so that it can
illuminate from down on the inside of you.
Illumination from your core-your God self. My people are looking for too much external light.
You have to learn how to walk in and through the night. When I send the darkness, Im giving
you an [2]opportunity to [3]grow. The allowance of the darkness is proof of my trust in what I
placed in you. But know that morning always comes, my love. I will reveal myself. I will show
up. I will fulfill my promises. Ive already sealed them with a yes.
Yes to what you long for. Yes to power. Yes to signs, miracles and wonders. Yes to no more
[4]barrenness. Yes to deliverance. Yes to wholeness. Yes to household salvation. Yes to peace.
Yes to fruitful relationships. Yes to love. Yes to strength. Yes to more of my presence. My
answer is yes; I will do it. You need only ask and trust me.
```

Praying that Hell strengthen you as you walk through the darkness.

Could I have your permission to copy your prayer - just for my private use? I have a notebook of inspiring thoughts
- and this prayer really touched me - I would love to be able to refer to it often.
Thank you for being faithful, and speaking the words that God wanted me to hear today.
BLESSINGS TO YOU!

oh my Wanda... this is powerful. And the picture of the clouds and the sunrays, is glorious. You would probably
know by now, how much I adore sky photos. It is one beautiful way He speaks to me too.
As I was reading this post, I was reminded of something. When we first walk into a dark room, without light, or even
outside at night, we can’t see much at all, only blackness... then little by little, as we push on by faith and tenacity,
our eyes adjust, and we can begin to see more clearly. I believe this is the same in the spiritual. It is faith and trust
in Him, that helps us adjust our spiritual eyes, to seeing in the dark times more clearly.
Loved this, thank you for posting from your precious journey.

## No Girls Allowed:Devotions for Boys (2010-09-14 08:00)

[1][2] [3]I know I broke the cardinal rule of this book by daring to peek inside
the pages of this devotional designed for elementary aged boys. But, as a Sunday school teacher (not to
mention an aunt, too), Im always on the lookout for creative ways to share the gospel with my students
and captivate their attention. So I jumped at the chance to review No Girls Allowed: Devotions for Boys by
Jayce ONeal.

ONeal does a good job at incorporating familiar topics, characters or shows like Batman, basketball, Scrooge,
video games and Nickelodeon into the devotions. Using a 2-page spread, every devotion contains a short
story, scripture point, prayer, puzzle, things to do, list of additional scriptures that tie into the lessons main
theme, and quotes from contemporary leaders.

I really like that the author shows boys how to apply the truths, found in each lesson, into their daily life
through the things to do section. Although I appreciated the idea of including puzzles, I felt that more
variety was needed rather than just secret codes, word search and crossword.

As someone wanting to use this to supplement Sunday school activities, I wished the book included an index
showing the theme and/or scripture emphasis for each lesson. Just listing the name of the story in the table
of contents provides little information about the aim of the devotion. More visually stimulating illustrations
would also enhance the book. Overall, I think the book provides solid Biblical teaching and would be a good
addition to preteen boys library.

For a preview of the book, click [4]here.

Thanks to Tyndale House for providing a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes. I was not
required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accor-
dance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16CFR, Part 255 ”Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements

## Web-Free Building (2010-09-15 00:00)

The wicked build houses as fragile as a spiders web, as flimsy as a shelter made of branches. Job 27:18
(NLT)

[1]
Now who would ever think of building a house with something as flimsy as a spiders web? I dare to say that
no one would, if they were able to see that the material was just a web. But Satan is so crafty in leading us
to believe that seeking fame and fortune is the way to build our lives. He spins the web of lies that say if we
just had more, more, more everything would be just right.
Can what youve chosen to build your life upon weather the storms life brings? Anything built without a
proper foundation will eventually fall.

Fill your cup with more of the Word this Wednesday at [2]Internet Cafe Devotions.

Great verse from Job, too - perfect!
GOD BLESS!

Amanda (2010-09-15 01:37:06)
Excellent WFW Wanda! I love it! So, so true... anything other than the foundation of Jesus Christ, is sheer vanity,
no matter how opulent it looks.
Funny, I was considering using a spiders web for todays WFW, but didn’t quite know what to say about it lol! But
you certainly nailed it... well done!

Joanne Sher (2010-09-15 03:31:46)
WOW, Wanda. Never noticed that verse before - and SUCH a great reminder to all of us! Thanks sweetie, and Happy

Great photo and thoughts shared.
such beauty in that web.......but it is so easily shattered.

MTJ (2010-09-15 06:57:34)
Hi Wanda,
When I saw the title of your post, my thoughts immediately focused on Internet web design; _probably because I was_
_researching web design software products this morning._
When I came to your blog and saw the picture, I smiled and thought, _Oh, the other web._
This scripture in Job is a vivid reminder of the need to trust in God and not in things. I recall that Jesus shared a
warning about the kind of foundation one builds a house upon (_Matthew 7:24-27_).
The lesson I gather from your post is that while Satan spin lies, we must be wise and discerning that the pursuit of
_material fame and fortune_ will not provide the security my life so desperately seeks.
This is a good devotional thought for the day.
Blessings and peace.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-09-15 07:00:45)
Oh, Wanda...such truth. Even in the natural, getting caught in a Spider’s web is not a pleasant experience. I think
we often forget why satan is in business.

lori (2010-09-15 07:29:18)
Wanda,
You’ve done it again! I’m going to be taking this and incorporating it into a ”fall” devo for my girls...you know it’s so
true that the webs entangle us if we aren’t continually aware of them. They are so fragile, we can destroy them easily
but they lurk in corners....
So much to think and pray on here!
love it!! Thank you for the blessing!

Kaye Swain - SandwichINK (2010-09-15 09:33:10)
Very true - terrific food for thought. And praise God for the sure foundation - Jesus Christ our Savior and Lord! :)

Peggy (2010-09-15 10:59:25)
Blessings Wanda... I guess only a spider and the victims that crawl into the web would build a house this flimsy. But
look at the intricacies of the work in the plan to capture, to draw us in... just like the lies of the world. Very powerful
and vivid! How true the value of a proper foundation before we try to build. The pieces or places that fall around us
are evident that we were not building with Him at the center and base; He is our Rock, our sure foundation!
I’m so thankful and give Jesus praise as my Rock, and the proper foundation I need to make it through life and my
walk. Thanks!
EnJOY WFW! Steer clear of the webs!
Peace,
Peggy

Nicole (2010-09-15 10:59:57)

Oh how true! I was just discussing this yesterday in my class yesterday with the teens I teach on Tuesdays. I realized

GlowinGirl (2010-09-15 14:05:22)
Isn’t that the truth. Satan is crafty, and he’s so good at making us believe his way is what we want. Spider webs are
all he’s spinning.

One Heart (2010-09-15 14:39:18)
Great words...but anything built upon the right foundation is icing on the cake. What comes to mind is Matthew
6:33 ”But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.”
If the heart has the order right, placing the intangible and eternal above the tangible and temporary, there is nothing
wrong with enjoying the temporary, as long as it doesn’t become first in our heart. We must seek Him continuously
for our hearts are deceptive. My cue is the fruit of the Spirit–do I have peace and love and joy in my midst.
Have a lovely Wednesday sis.

vain. Building any other way is indeed foolish.

That’s a great verse, and a very good reminder to keep our priorities straight. Satan is very crafty indeed and we
often get trapped in his web of lies. Thanks for sharing!

## You Know How to Brighten the Day (2010-09-17 07:00)

Dont you just love when unexpected blessings come your way? Ive been feeling like a kid at Christmas.
Lately, my mailbox has been full of sweet surprises (not just those never ending bills) and they seem to show
up on the very day I could use a little cheering up the most. Not long ago, I was blessed to win two beautiful
photos from Valerie of [1]Intelligent Expression and I couldnt wait to hang them. If you havent see her
work, you should stop by for a visit. She combines photos with a quote and scripture. Oh, and Ive got this
brand new devotional,sent to me by a special blogger friend, that I look forward to reading in my quiet time.

A little bit a go my sweet blogger friend, [2]Yvonne of Welcome to My World of Poetry passed this award on
to me. Sorry for the delay in acknowledging it and passing it on. Although she already has it, Id definitely

like to pass it back to her. Shes been a wonderful support to me. Id also like to pass it on to: [3]Ellie,
Bluebutterfly, Bud, [4]Karen, [5]MTJ, Monica, [6]JBR, [7]Peggy, and [8]One Heart.

[9]
And my crafty blogger friend, Ellie at [10]Ellas Edge passed on the Happy 101 award to me recently. Im
supposed to dazzle you with 10 things I like and pass the award forward. Ha&I know thats just the top
secret information, you were waiting to hear today.

[11]

Ok, drum roll. Heres my top 10 (well maybe not the top but definitely some things I like (:

1. Theres just something I tend to like more about Fridays than Mondays.
2. I like browsing the blogosphere to see whats going on in your neck of the woods, although Ive had
less time to do that lately.
3. On a hot summers day, I like the way a ice cold coke hits the right spot. (theres nothing like the real
thang baby)
4. A long drive on a beautiful day but its even better when Im being driven ;)
5. I really like the smell of Pandamonium oil in my effusion lamp. (Made several trips to Ellis pottery for
that special fragrance)
6. Hearing the birds chirp in the morning and gazing at the sky
7. Leafing through the pages of my latest bookstore find
8. Speaking of books, I really like [12]PaperBackSwap.com (Join the Club and Swap Books for Free!).
9. Im in strong like with windows live writer (upcoming post about this soon)

10. And I like to know, why does Bella (my doggy) like chewing on paper and everything but the toys Ive
bought her.

Now lets hear from: [13]Amanda, [14]Sarah, [15]CeCe, [16]Missie, [17]Kim, [18]Anne Katherine, [19]Joanne,
[20]Sharon
Now youre free to post the award & pass it on to others, if you choose and even if you dont, just know
youre thought of today.
A picture, a book, a card, an email, a comment or even a blog award may not take much to pass along but
one never knows how that simple gesture may really water the ground its sowed into. Thanks to each of
you, whove taken a moment to dash a little water here through your visits. May it be multiplied unto you
many times over.

## Victory Through Him (2010-09-18 19:30)

Psalm 62

For Jeduthun, the choir director: A psalm of David.

[^1]: I wait quietly before God,
for my victory comes from him.
[^2]: He alone is my rock and my salvation,
my fortress where I will never be shaken.

[^3]: So many enemies against one man
all of them trying to kill me.
To them Im just a broken-down wall
or a tottering fence.
[^4]: They plan to topple me from my high position.
They delight in telling lies about me.
They praise me to my face
but curse me in their hearts.
_Interlude_

[^5]: Let all that I am wait quietly before God,
for my hope is in him.
[^6]: He alone is my rock and my salvation,
my fortress where I will not be shaken.
[^7]: My victory and honor come from God alone.
He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me.
[^8]: O my people, trust in him at all times.
Pour out your heart to him,
for God is our refuge.
_Interlude_

[^9]: Common people are as worthless as a puff of wind,
and the powerful are not what they appear to be.
If you weigh them on the scales,
together they are lighter than a breath of air.

[^10]: Dont make your living by extortion or put your hope in stealing.
And if your wealth increases,
dont make it the center of your life.

[^11]: God has spoken plainly,
and I have heard it many times:
Power, O God, belongs to you;
[^12]: unfailing love, O Lord, is yours.

Surely you repay all people
according to what they have done.

source: [1]Bible Gateway

This psalm was a part of my Bible reading this morning. As I read it, I was reminded of the beautiful,
praise-stirring prayer of [2]VICTORY by MJT I read on yesterday. Like David, I have those times when it
seems there is so much against me. It looks to others and sometimes EVEN to me that this time Im not
going to make it out. But this psalm and his prayer reminds me that victory IS my predetermined end. Not
because theres anything so great or good about me or what I can do but because who God is and what He
already established for my life. Im so grateful that God was so wise and mindful to leave written records
such as this psalm that I can read and reflect upon in times of adversity. Or He causes my path to cross
with another one of His children that speaks or writes a word that refuels my hope and confidence in God.

Hi Wanda,
I am grateful to have found the words of encouragement on the pages of this blog. The title The Watered Soul is so
appropriate.
Recently, you wrote about the passage of scripture in Ephesians (6) and as I meditated on the scripture I began to
see something which for me, was what I need to do; stand, walk and live in the faith and victory I have in Christ.
The life I live, though it may be temporal, though it may experience pain, sorrow and grief, will not deter me from
my faith in the risen Savior and Lord.
I appreciate you as a fellow Christian.
Blessings and peace.

Amanda (2010-09-19 04:08:32)
Amen Wanda... I love the Psalms because in it, we hear the heart of David (most of them were written by him).
Many of them were borne out of his struggles and over-whelming trials. We can all relate to him on so many levels
even though not many of our trials were as severe as his.
I always find encouragement and inspiration through the posts you write... I am very grateful for your blog!

## But, I want to go this way {Monday Manna} (2010-09-20 23:23)

[1]

For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways,”
declares the LORD.
”As the heavens are higher than the earth,
so are my ways higher than your ways
and my thoughts than your thoughts. Isaiah 55:8-9

When I saw that Isaiah 55:8-9 was the passage for Joannes [2]Monday Manna, one of the first things to
come to my mind was His thoughts and ways are definitely NOT like mine. Which of course is a good thing
but that doesnt mean I always see it that way. That probably doesnt sound very nice for a self-professed
Christ follower, but, nevertheless its true anyway.

As I thought on this scripture, my mind went back to all the thoughts and plans I had for my life over
a decade ago. I can look on those thoughts and plans of mine with both gladness and sadness. Some things
I thought for sure were what I wanted only to get them and find that it wasnt all Id chalked it up to be in
my own mine. Others meant so little to me then but now as the days, months, and years fly by without any
sign of them on the horizon, I find myself questioning Lord how long.

Just like He guided the Israelites along the long way to Canaan for a reason, I have to trust that the steps
Im taking along my life journey are preparing me for the promised place. Even when I cant perceive the
good in it, I must trust that He indeed has a plan and its good and not evil.

MTJ (2010-09-21 00:28:29)
Hi Wanda,
What a wonderful scripture to share for anyone seeking to experience success in life. I realize that success is not
determined by what one gains or the recognition for achieving a set goal, true success is measured by my willingness
to obey God.
While acquiring wealth, status, position, fulfilling the achievement of a goal or being recognized for an accomplish-
ment is worthy and admirable, hearing the words, ”Well done!” from the Creator of all life should be my number
one priority.
Like you, I have often found how my thinking differs from the Lord. This discrepancy has always been to my regret.
I believe all things happen for a specific reason and therefore there is a purpose to all things that occur. I’m not
talking about cause and effect, I’m speaking to the plans and purposes of God.
Though I may not understand them as they unfold, I am assured that He is working all things together for my good
(benefit). I can depend on Him.
Blessings and peace.

LisaShaw (2010-09-21 00:46:36)
Amen sis! Trusting His path and plan for my life which is a far cry BETTER than any plan I had.
I remember in high school I was going to go into the Marines. Shortly after HS I had long term plans for becoming a
prosecuting attorney.
Hence GOD’s plan was for me to be a mommy/grandma, wife and minister with my husband. HIS PLANS ARE
BETTER!!! Hallelujah!
Thanks for sharing dear one!
His plans are better!

```
Wanda (2010-09-21 02:17:10)
Joanne, I was happy to do so. It’s interesting to see what others glean from the same passage of scripture.
MTJ, hearing Well done is by far better than anything we can achieve or possess down here.
Lisa, they definitely are. I just wish he’d give me more details...lol
```

```
Bernadine (2010-09-21 02:28:08)
I find myself nodding in agreement as I read this because this is so where I’m at lately. I find myself constantly asking
Him for details but He wants my walk to be a walk of faith. So as you said,
”Even when I cant perceive the good in it, I must trust that He indeed has a plan and its good and not evil.”
Thanks for sharing.
```

```
Wanda (2010-09-21 11:41:51)
Bernadine, the road in between what used to be and the promised place can be quite uncomfortable. But He didn’t
call us to comfort but FAITH.
```

```
welcome to my world of poetry (2010-09-21 16:27:41)

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-09-21 17:39:40)
One of the toughest battles of the Christian walk is not that of surrendering our thoughts and plans to God, it is in
knowing that our thoughts and plans are not like His. Most of us would happily accept the will of God if we were
certain it would just be a rubber stamp on our own desires.
All I can say is, ”Lord, I want to be more like You.”
```

## Psalms {Life Change Series} (2010-09-21 06:00)

Could David have been the first blogger?

```
It’s GREAT that we have David’s words to read... he experienced and wrote about so many
different feelings that we experience. Hey, now that I think about it, David was like the first
blogger, wasn’t he?!
```

[1]Michelle made this comment to a post I wrote on [2]Psalms 142:4-5.

I never had thought about him in that way. He might not have been a blogger in todays sense of the word
but He certainly had a good rapport with God. A myriad of emotions are freely expressed throughout the
book of Psalms.

[3] In the latest edition of the LifeChange series Bible studies, the Navigators takes
readers on a journey of prayer through the book of Psalms. Not just prayers of praise and worship but it
also includes prayers of intercession and supplication, renewal and restoration, vindication and forgiveness
among several others. The study contains 10 lessons that are designed to be used as a group study but can
be done individually as well.

Each lesson contains a lesson objective, desired action, Psalms for the lesson, and study questions. Par-
ticipants are encouraged to delve deeper into the lessons theme through the use of additional application
activities and further study assignments.

What I like about the study:

• Its not just a read the scripture and fill in the blank study. Questions are designed for you to study
the scripture and discover for oneself how it applies to their lives.
• Perfect size to carry along with you.
• Provides a listing of additional study aides
• Includes a basic group leaders guide for each lesson

One thing to note is that the study does not proceed through the book of Psalms by chapters but based
upon themes. Each lesson discusses several Psalms passages. Its simple design and layout provides little
visual appeal but offers a good starter map for anyone wanting a fresh view of Psalms.

Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from NavPress Publishers as part of their Blogger
Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I
am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commision’s 16 CFR, Part 255: ”Guides Concerning
the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”

## Heard the News (2010-09-22 02:25)

[1]

With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands, and encourage those who have weak knees. Say to
those with fearful hearts, Be strong, and do not fear, for your God is coming to destroy your enemies. He
is coming to save you. Isaiah 35:3-4

When is the last time you heard something positive on your local news channel? I really make it a point not
to watch much of the news. It seems there are so many reports of stealing and killing and I can do without
the visuals haunting me in my sleep.

As I read through my daily reading the other day, Isaiah 35:3-4 stood out to me. Here the people were
instructed to take the news they had heard and use it to strengthen and encourage others. He identifies
three types of individuals who needed the news:

• Had tired hands  are there some assignments that youve gotten weary carrying out?
• Had weak knees  are there some prayer requests that youre not sure you have the strength to bring
before the Father again? Or perhaps you been in a holding position and it feels as if you cant stand
too much longer.
• Had fearful hearts  has the length of time between what you thought you heard and the manifestation
caused you to begin to fear or doubt?

Im raising my hand and saying Yes, YEs, YES! But I read the NEWS and it gives a report of CHANGE,
HOPE, and SALVATION. Today, I take comfort and strength in this good news and I pray that you will
too.

This is such an encouraging WFW, Wanda. I like how you expanded on those scriptures...
I am like you, I don’t watch much news at all. Actually, none. I look at news headlines on the computer and that I
can select what I am comfortable hearing about.
Happy WFW lovely sis...

Wanda - this is such an encouraging post. I also raise my hand to all three questions, but praise God for His salvation,
grace, and mercy. In Christ alone is where we find hope.
Blessings,

Cherie Hill (2010-09-22 06:13:43)
What a great post Wanda! The Lord lead me to the book of Isaiah over the past week and has been speaking volumes
to me! I think the whole book could be summed up in two words:
Justice and Deliverance!
Love,hugs,and prayers,
Cherie

Hand raised here as well! What an awesome post this morning...what an encouraging post! I will be passing this on

Wanda, thank you for always encouraging and edifying each week! You’re amazing!

That verse has been on my heart today after I got out the wrong side of the bed.....Madam Moggie was occupying the
right side at my feet, so it usually easier to roll out the other side, but I tripped on a small cushion and crashed down
on my two replaced knees. Being on them is a bit like being on a bed of nails and I had to walk on them a little to get
to the bed and pull myself up. But I did not hit either of two sets of drawers ...nor did I hit my head on a doorway or
anything...sore elbow and a shaken up body...but yet an awareness that even in the fall I was kept in His power and
love.

WOW Wanda...now that’s GOOD NEWS!
I need His strength & encouragement
though my hands are not tired right now nor are my knees weak! My heart is not fearful... now on to finish what you
shared about these verses from the great prophet Isaiah!
I need any good report and this changes it, now that I have your perspective of tired hands, weak knees, and fearful
hearts! I kinda thought that maybe I had weak knees... I will take comfort today
in a good report from GOD for CHANGE, HOPE and SALVATION - the best news we have to share with a world
that is hurting and breaking!
So many that don’t even realize that they NEED HIM!

Peace & thanks for your encouragement,

GlowinGirl (2010-09-22 13:41:09)
Girl, this is GOOD NEWS, indeed! I, too, am a news-avoider simply because I believe the media tends to prey on
our fears and sensationalize things until I’d be too scared to leave my house. God is good, strong and mighty, and I
need not fear because His news is the best of all!
LOVE this WFW!

## Stress Free Life :Seven Keys to Extraordinary Life (2010-09-26 23:19)

[1] What comes to mind when you hear the word stress? Is it juggling family
and career? Or perhaps the demands of ministry endeavors are weighing you down. Whatever your personal
situation, stress is something we all can personally identify with. At the time the opportunity to review
_Stress Free Life: Seven Keys to Extraordinary Life_ by Bishop Bonnie Etta presented itself, I wasnt feeling
much stress but who couldnt use some extra tools for handling stress effectively.

Bishop Etta divides the book into two sections. Section one outlines the seven keys to living extraordinarily
and section two focuses on ways to reign in life. He identifies the seven keys as:

• **Healed Through Love** -discusses how our life flows from our love of God and some of the hindrances
to walking in love like mistrust, human failings, rejection and abuse

• **The Beauty of Forgiveness**  looks at how choosing to release hurts and offences brings liberation
from stress
• **The Power of Truth**  points out the importance of being willing to face the truth and living
authentically
• **The Peace of Unity**- calls readers to unity not just with others but within themselves
• **The Grace of Appreciation**-reminds us of the value of gratitude
• **Intimacy Through Communication**-communicates the value of relationships with others
• **The Creative Force of Faith**illustrates how faith is the necessary building block for our lives.

It was an interesting read and there were several statements that stood out enough for me to write them
down. Here are few:

_Cowards die in silence; they are influenced by people__s opinions, people__s appearances and even by the en-_
_vironment in which they find themselves. Cowards die with truths they never experimented; they die with_
_life-giving keys they never used. They die with words they never released because of fear._

Needless to say I re-discovered that Im a coward.

_Stress is based upon false pictures and based upon false ideas regarding yourself and the situation you may_
_find yourself in. Stress hates to face the truth, stress hates truth._

Many times I have been worried about something but when I actually faced the situation, it wasn’t near as
bad as I had conjured up in my mind.

The author not only addresses individuals but the church as well.

_The body of Christ is sick today in many countries because the various Christian bodies or denominations_
_have lost their focus. Therefore their followers have no purpose and have nothing to do after being saved_
_except to pay tithes and offerings._

Some of the author’s theories, I did not agree with like his conclusions on the cause of poverty. On page 67
he writes,

_Poverty is born out of unbiblical way of life practices. Poverty is not a blessing from God; it does not_
_have the nature and image of God. It is caused by foolishness, ungodliness, wicked political systems and_
_caused by the enemy of human life; the devil._

_About the Author:_

Bishop Bonnie Etta is the senior pastor and founder of the World Vision International Worship Center in
Beltsville MD, one of the fastest growing multinational nondenominational church. He is an international
conference speaker, author, counselor, and singer and oversees the World Vision Outreach ministries.

He holds a Masters in Ministry and he is the author of another book entitled _Becoming Your Dream_, which
has given hope and courage to millions around the world.

_Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary copy of this by Bostick Communications as a part of their blogger_
_review program. The opinions expresses are my own._

How interesting and I must say, I ’m a coward right there with you. That is something I struggle with, but that I
know I am overcoming by God’s grace. I will pray that you do as well. Thanks for the review. I see posts like these
as God’s little reminders that we may be stuck in a certain place, but we don’t have to stay there.
Have a blessed and wonderful week Sis.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-09-27 07:29:39)
A most interesting review of the author about stress, it has the opposite views I have read about stress over the years,
aliet very good I’m sure both ways of dealing with stress has the same outcome, as I believe you have to BELIVE
what you’re reading.
Have a good day.
Yvonne.

Wanda (2010-09-27 12:31:03)
It was my first time reading any work from this author, MTJ.
Lisa, I’m glad to know that I’m not that only one that tends to be a coward at times but you’re right we don’t have
to stay that way. Hope you have a great week too!
Yvonne, it was definitely a different take on handling stress. I don’t know if we’ll ever be totally stress free in this
life. Besides stress can be both good and bad.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-09-27 14:55:05)
Thanks Wanda. That word ”fear” and stress are so tied together. It will spin you in circles until you fall in complete
exhaustion. My motto is always to fight fear using God’s word....daily.

Now that’s a wise motto, Blue! We have to use the weapons God has provided us.

## Just a Few Steps From Home (2010-09-27 17:34)

[1]
Its something about those last few steps from the house that seem the most arduous when finishing up my
walk. Just when I can finally see my house in sight, my strength wanes. As I rounded the corner Saturday,
with my home in full view, God interrupted my walk to illustrate to me the position that I believe many
find themselves in at this very moment.
Why would coming home be hard? For me, my home is a place of comfort. My little place of tranquility
from the noisiness of the outside world. It contains so many of things I love. So, it seems Id be sprinting
home.
Spiritually speaking home represents our connectedness with the Father. He showed me that many people
weve been praying for are just a few steps from home. But these last few steps before turning their lives
over to God are often the most difficult. Sure theyre tired from the toiling of their current lives but they
wonder can they really make it to God. The bondages of sin confines their movement and thoughts in their
minds try to convince them that theyll never make it. Its too late. Theyve already missed their chance.
Or theyve done too much.
Home is not just a place of comfort but its also a place of responsibility. Owning a home requires that I pay
some bills and provide maintenance to the house. In the same way, giving our lives to God positions us for
responsibility. Im not talking in the sense that we have to earn our salvation. Salvation is an unmerited gift
made available to all of us because of the finished work of the cross. But many wonder when I make it to
God can I really do all that He requires. Can I live up to His name? Can I be a proper reflection of Him?
As we pray for others, we are not always able to see outwards signs of their moving closer to Him. Yet I’m
encouraged to continue pressing and praying. For who knows, today just may be the day they return home.

MTJ (2010-09-27 18:29:19)
Hi Wanda,
You’ve written such a sensitive and thoughtful post. You’re right in saying that, ”**we are not always able to see**
**outwards signs**”, that those we pray for are moving closer to God; _but we can trust the Lord with their life just as_
_we trust Him with our own._
Blessings and peace.

Pushing and praying indeed. Well God knows just when we need to hear thing Blue b/c I’ve had the draft of this
post written for over a week but finally felt it was time to post it. Appreciate all of you stopping by.

Amanda (2010-09-28 11:31:13)
oh wow!!! I LOVE what He showed you! So true!
When I walk our newest dog of an afternoon, she picks up the scent of home half a block away. And.she.runs. And,
I have to try to keep up to her lol. She is on a lead so I have little choice. But she is so skitterish away from home,
and can’t wait to get back there for all it’s familiarity and security.
We can learn from this dog I think. That’s for the Christians. The ones about to ’come home to Him’, do often
struggle to make the final half block because of the what-ifs and spiritual battles.
Excellent post my sister!

Rae (2010-09-28 13:42:20)
You never fail to provoke thankfulness and humbleness in my heart. Your posts always start my day with a positive

As I read this I thought about one particular person very dear to me who I believe fits what you’ve described in this

loving relationship with Jesus Christ. Thank you for this post. It was a very encouraging reminder.

## Spreading the Sweet Stuff (2010-09-29 00:00)

[1]
But thanks be to God, who made us his captives and leads us along in Christ’s triumphal procession. Now
wherever we go he uses us to tell others about the Lord and to spread the Good News like a sweet perfume.
2 Corinthians 2: 14 (NLT)
I love the way The Message paraphrases this passage, too.
In the Messiah, in Christ, God leads us from place to place in one perpetual victory parade. Through us, he
brings knowledge of Christ. Everywhere we go, people breathe in the exquisite fragrance. Because of Christ,
we give off a sweet scent rising to God, which is recognized by those on the way of salvationan aroma
redolent with life. But those on the way to destruction treat us more like the stench from a rotting corpse.
2 Corinthians 2:15-16
For some reason this passage of scripture took me back to my elementary school cafeteria, where the scent
of barbecue wieners (and know, I dont mean grilled ones either but ones covered in some kind of weird
barbecue sauce) would set off a gag reflex in me. Now for those who enjoyed that little delicacy, it was no
doubt a pleasing aroma. Each of us was served the same meal but smelled something very different. Likewise
with the message of Christto one it smells sweet yet to another it stinks.

It is so true!! You wrote a great analogy to drive the message home lol! Weiners!! haha!
I love the whole imagery provoked by ’aroma, fragrance’ scriptures and I LOVED how the Message worded this.
Straight to the point.
Well done and have a great WFW Wanda!

```
Joan (2010-09-29 05:54:51)
Wanda - I had to smile at the cafeteria smell. I think we had those same barbequed weiners in our cafeteria. (And I
agree about the smell.)
Your post is so full of truth. Often people reject the message of Christ - it isn’t pleasant and sweet to them. Oh, that
they would know the glorious riches of knowing Him.
Blessings,
Joan

MTJ (2010-09-29 06:04:36)
Hi Wanda,
I find it interesting that God uses our sense of smell to distinguish those attracted to Him against those opposed to
Him. Often, my sense of smell made the decision for me without really knowing whether a certain type of food tasted
good. As a child, I hated the smell of Black-eyed Peas but years later, after tasting them, I grew to love Black-eyed
Peas. Too often, people reject God without ever having a genuine relationship with Him.
Blessings and peace.

Forget the cafeteria...for me it was coming home to smell mom making liver and onions for dinner...may I NEVER
smell like that...;)
peace,

Peggy (2010-09-29 11:07:51)
Blessings Wanda... Beautifully done!
Love the way you wrapped the graphics around the ”fragrance”.
I, too, agree that it’s really helpful to have this vivid imagery,
(I’m like that about some foods and smells also, like my neighbor’s strong burnt coffee smell) and the comparison of
the versions!
This verse was one that became very REAL to me, and was the first verse I chose to memorize in
[1]2009
after reading a wonderful book. And I could not find its title but I’ll let you know when I do.
EnJOY WFW!
Peggy

I love how you describe it too.
Like others said it is great how some of us are just attracted to Him!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-09-29 13:36:59)
I love this. As someone with allergies, even a ”sweet” smell can trigger something ugly. It’s not the aroma so much
as my ability to receive. When I prepare though, I can handle the smell. As I was reading this post, I thought back
to John The Baptist, and how even Christ had a way prepared for Him, so His presence would be received. I really
thank God that He makes it so that a way is prepared so those who desire the aroma of His presence can be prepared
to receive.

Denise (2010-09-29 13:50:58)

I ”ditto” the sentiments of Ms. Sharon Kirby. I certainly pray that I emit a sweet fragrance of Christ and that it is
received that way to believers and unbelievers alike. The unbeliever may not recognize the scent, but my prayer it
will be attractive enough for him/her to follow his nose. :-)
Blessings to you, dear Wanda!

Ellie (2010-09-30 19:02:23)
I love how you did this, how our senses can take us so many places and how what is good for one, isn’t for another at
that moment. Perhaps we are just on a different page at that second in time

Petula (2010-10-01 06:54:33)
That is a fabulous analogy to solidify your point. I never thought of it like that. Excellent.

Melissa in Mel’s World (2010-10-01 08:54:28)
Love this verse and graphic!!! Great job, thanks so much for sharing for WFW! :)

## 1.8 October

## Hes Still Working Miracles (2010-10-01 17:13)

[1] Earlier today I read a post by Beth over at [2]Im Headed
Towards My Destiny and she certainly gave the post a fitting title-[3]You Must Read This. She shares how
during a recent casual visit with one of her cousins the Miracle Worker showed up! Reading it stirred my
faith this morning. I have read about such miracles in days of old but havent laid my natural eyes on one
of that type, yet. But I [4]heard the news that Hes moving over in NC. Could Arkansas be next? Or maybe
Hes already show up at your residence. If He hasnt, keep looking! He promised in His Word He would show
up when we call Him.
If youre like me, you have called Him about some things but Hes yet to appear in that particular area. I
know some times my courage and my faith wanes so much so that I dont feel like praying about that again.
But, like my pastor said during Sundays message, do IT again. PRAY again. BELIEVE again. HOPE
again. TRUST again. DECLARE His Word again.
Again, I ask could Arkansas be next? Well I already know Hes moving here, too. Just last Saturday, my
sister interrupted our phone conversation to answer a call from our cousin. After not hearing back from
her for a while, I assumed she had gotten busy but eventually she did call back with wonderful news. She
described how this male cousin of ours was expressing his experience with the spirit of the Lord and how
much he hungered for more of God. During the course of their conversation, she said he just wept and shared
how he longed for other members of our family to have this same experience.
While she shared this with me, I was in sheer amazement. Why? I mean I am a believer in Jesus Christ.
But I still listened in shocked wonderment because I was hearing with my own ears the report of the miracle
worker showing up on a side of my family that I least expected. The two sides of my family are like vanilla
and chocolate or oil and water. One has a long history of walking with God and the other an even longer
history of walking in the ways of the world. Dont misunderstand me; both sides of the family have its share
of rebels and redeemed ones but the concentration mix is different between the two.
After reading Beths post and reflecting on the conversation with my sister, I cant help but give Him praise.
[5]Who else but God can bring healing? Who else but the Sovereign One can make Himself known to those
we often consider as hard cases? Is there anything too hard for Him?
Don’t you know anything? Haven’t you been listening? God doesn’t come and go. God lasts. He’s Creator
of all you can see or imagine. He doesn’t get tired out, doesn’t pause to catch his breath. And he knows
everything, inside and out. Isaiah 40:28 (The Message)

Wanda, God is showing me constantly lately (!) that HE is moving on my behalf. I may not see the answer or the
way, but He knows.
I’m so glad to hear that God is moving in the life of your family. He can be depended on – He can be trusted!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MTJ (2010-10-02 05:16:11)

What you share is worthy of praise to our Lord.
Blessings and peace.

Well this certainly fired me up! How infectious is His Spirit, that fanes the flame in our hearts!!
Loved hearing about your cousin. You know Wanda, one thing I have noticed in God, is that it is those you least
expect, who bow their knees to Him. Every time I think it will be ’this’ one, it turns out to be ’that’ one. Amazing...
Love and hugs sister...

```
Bernadine (2010-10-03 20:45:29)
I enjoy reading about how God is moving in the lives of others. I can so identify when you wrote about praying about
”that” again but like you I’m encouraged to do it again.
Thanks for sharing.

Pat (2010-10-04 17:20:23)
Hello Wanda my first visit here and I did enjoy your post very much!!! Yes I’m also expecting a visit soon from my
Saviour and it’s going to be great because truly nothing is to hard for God,and all of his promises are true ”Hallelu-
jah”!!! Have a fantastic day Wanda I’ll be back soon.
Love ya

Cherie Hill (2010-10-05 12:29:12)
I love how God ”surprisingly” shows up. I love how He ”suddenly” moves powerfully! But, it’s all no surprise to Him
```

... it’s happened just as He planned all along. AND we should have been ”expecting” Him. I pray, everyday, that
when He looks at me, ”I will be found in Him”... full of faith... consumed with hope... with my eyes fixed
upon Him.
Blessings sister,
Cherie

lioneagle (2010-10-14 21:51:44)
Greetings -
Wanda, this is a blessing to hear about your cousin. It reminds that GOD’s thoughts are not our thoughts nor are
His ways our ways.
He is so beyond our abilities to comprehend.
I loved what Amanda wrote too, she said, ”Well this certainly fired me up! How infectious is His Spirit, that fanes
the flame in our hearts!!” Amen!

## As Weeks Go By (2010-10-05 23:30)

All humanity will come to worship me from week to week and from month to month. Isaiah 66:23 (NLT)

”For just as the new heavens and new earth

that I am making will stand firm before me”
God’s Decree
”So will your children
and your reputation stand firm.
Month after month and week by week,
everyone will come to worship me,” God says. Isaiah 66:22-23 (The Message) [2]

Wanda (2010-10-07 05:31:08)
Thanks to each of you that stopped by and shared your thoughts. Your visits are always appreciated. This verse was
one I recently discovered during my one-year Bible reading. There’s no better way to spend our weeks and months
than in worship to Him. May all that you do and say be an offering to Him. Jhunnelle, I like to compare verses in
different versions of the Bible. It has way helping me see it through fresh eyes.

## Pebble or Rock (2010-10-07 10:46)

As I drove home yesterday evening, I found myself singing, when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the
rock. The rock that’s higher than I. Those two lines of the song had me reflecting on God as my rock. I just
love the imagery that is found in the Bible.
Tiny Pebbles

[1]
Plenty of rocks can be found in my drive way and I don’t give those little small stones much thought on a
daily basis. The car is driven over them day after day. Bella and I walk on them. Sometimes they’re picked
up and tossed about by little hands that come to visit. Heavy rains push them out of their position. Those
rocks are easily moved and manipulated. They offer little or no resistance to the forces that come up against
it. Is that the rock I see when reading scriptures that calls God my rock and my fortress? Is that your view
of the rock? Of course, we’d be inclined to give a quick ”no” in response to such question. But, the more I
ponder it in my mind, I have this caution urging me not rush past but dwell here at this point for a while.
Could it be that the rock I’m seeing is too small? When faced with the everyday challenges life bring, my
initial reaction is one that sees the problem so large that I can’t even get a glimpse of the rock upon which
I’m suppose to stand.
Does my response, my prayer, my thoughts, my attitude or my demeanor show that I see Him as one who
offers little resistance to forces that oppose me-His child? He is not just concern with my words but what
is my behavior speaking? Does it say I think trouble can drive Him away? Does my whining and fretting
reveal that deep down I believe that the thing I’m up against is large enough to move, push or manipulate
Him?

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-10-07 11:23:18)
A wonderful post to read Wanda, Although I visit the beach daily I have never thought of pebbles and rocks in the
way you do.
Yvonne.
```

```
MTJ (2010-10-07 12:08:05)
Hi Wanda,
A compelling and thought-provoking post. I think there are times when my words and behavior have not been aligned.
This I believe is the result of a kind of wishful thinking; hoping that God will respond in spite of my doubts and fears.
But I now see that God’s desire for me is to experience a mature relationship with Him that’s based on genuine biblical
faith.
You raise valid questions regarding faith and trust in God:
```

1. **Is that the rock I see when reading scriptures that calls God my rock and my fortress?**
2. **Is that your view of the rock?**
3. **Does my response, my prayer, my thoughts, my attitude or my demeanor show that I see Him as**
**one who offers little resistance to forces that oppose me-His child?**
4. **He is not just concern with my words but what is my behavior speaking?**
5. **Does it say I think trouble can drive Him away?**
6. **Does my whining and fretting reveal that deep down I believe that the thing I’m up against is large**
**enough to move, push or manipulate Him?**
I believe these questions help bring into focus both _How I see God_ and _Who I see God is._ In answering these two
questions, I realize I must also answer the question:
**What does it mean to be God?**
You’ve given me much to consider, meditate and I believe a topic to write my personal thoughts about. _With your_
_permission, I’d like to use this post as a framework to address my answers._
Blessings and peace.

lioneagle (2010-10-07 13:03:56)
Hi Wanda -
Thank you for these wise words...
I agree with MTJ...so much to ponder...
The rock photo speaks - love it!

PatriciaW (2010-10-07 13:49:50)
Ooh, Wanda, you’re saying something here.
Some many rocks. Some big, some small. Yes, He is the rock. My rock. But what kind of rock – more porous or more
solid? How big a rock – a pebble or a mountain?
Never considered this, but you’ve got me thinking. Good stuff.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-07 16:54:12)
He is our Rock. As I read this I remember being at my grandfather’s house in the mountains. In that high up place,
I always felt that nothing could touch me. Jesus, that Rock, who is higher...is where I want to be.

sarah (2010-10-07 22:18:48)
nice post to read and think of the pebbles and stones in this way.

Just Be Real (2010-10-07 23:26:08)
Thank you Wanda for sharing this powerful truth. Needed to read.

Carrie of Farming On Faith (2010-10-07 23:48:42)
Hello
I am so glad to meet you. Your blog is lovely. I am so glad you stopped by today.
I am going to peek around a bit.
Have a lovely evening!

Pat (2010-10-08 03:32:48)
Wanda this is a very powerful post!!! I am guilty of looking at my problems a lot of the time instead of looking to my
Rock that cannot be moved.

Sharon Kirby (2010-10-08 03:50:47)
Wanda - So very thought-provoking. I know that all too often, the rock I’m seeing IS too small. The problem seems
bigger. In fact, it seems so big that I neglect to see that the SHADOW of my Rock, my Lord, is covering it.
”Does my whining and fretting reveal that deep down I believe that the thing I’m up against is large enough to move,
push, or manipulate Him?”
This convicted me deeply. Yes, Lord, I need to see you bigger. Not a pebble, but a Mt. Everest...
Thanks, Wanda - GOD BLESS!

Ellie (2010-10-08 11:37:05)
Interesting view; I agree sometimes we do think our problems are huge like large rocks and sometimes not.
It is an interesting way to look at how we can interpret things in our life and the scope, dimension and size. How our
will, soul is affected Great post!

Wanda (2010-10-08 12:53:21)
When I sat down to write the post, I had something else in mind but God took me along another path. I hope to do
a second part to this post, when the time allows. MTJ, I look forward to gleaning from your thoughts as you reflect
upon this topic.

LisaShaw (2010-10-11 19:18:24)
Wanda,
This is powerful! Your questions in the last paragraph are so on point!
Thank you for being REAL!
Hugs and love!

Faith Imagined (2010-10-12 13:42:56)
This is some wonderful self-reflection. Every time I worry I remind myself that I am thinking less of God than I should
be. I don’t need to worry. I have to continually remind myself that he is BIG ENOUGH!

Peggy (2010-10-12 19:10:13)
Blessings Wanda, Came here from MTJ’s post! and as always love the power in which you write & share from a heart
that’s REAL and seeking Him!
I too often sing this song when my heart is overwhelmed! Beautiful reflections throughout this since I hardly ever
pause and think on how profound it is to call Him Our Rock!
Definitely not a pebble to me! He is a Mountain mover!!! When I lean on Him, I quickly realize that He is the
immovable, impenetrable, strong, foundation that holds me when all else may be crumbling around me!
I knew I would love this... and I do! The questions stir me to put this belief into action in words & thoughts and all
I do! Standing on the Rock! Holding on to our Rock!
Responding in His Strength! our Strong Tower! our Fortress! I often see Him surrounding me this way like the
Alhambra in Spain, a castled walled city... He is our Defender! our Protector! no other force can compare or oppose
Him, how often we cower when we should stand on all we believe He is and not allow anything to deter us or come
against us! We are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus! Thanks!
In Christ’s peace & love,
Peggy

Nicole (2010-10-14 17:31:29)
What a great post Wanda! Thank you so much for sharing it.
I think I need to fix how I see things too and make sure that the Rock I am seeing is my fortress!
I love the last paragraph! So very true.
I have got to get back to seeing how big our Lord is and knowing He is in control and handles everything!

```
Wanda (2010-10-15 03:04:56)
Thanks for adding your thoughts, Lisa, Alisa, Peggy, and Nicole. I think we all can use an adjustment to our per-
spective on the greatness of God. May each you continue to stand upon the Rock.
```

```
Dean Spencer (2010-10-17 04:46:46)
Wanda -
I arrived at your post via MTJ at My Though-filled Journey. I like what you’re saying here. It’s true that we can
have a very limited view of who our God is...as you say, Could it be that the rock I’m seeing is too small?”
I’m now a follower of yours. Looking forward to reading more. God bless!

## A Prayer (2010-10-08 11:44)

[1] Oh Lord, there is none like you! For you are great, and your name
is full of power. You reign supreme over all creation. The heavens and the earth declare your glory. From
generation to generation, you prove your faithfulness. You are adorned in righteousness and majesty. Since
the time of my birth, I’ve heard your name declared. You have been the keeper of my soul. It is you who
holds me together in the midst of chaos. You’ve kept my mind. You’ve kept me alive, when I thought I
would surely die. You’ve been peace for me. You have been my way when there seemed to be no way. You
have been my counselor, my physician, my guide, my compass, my comforter, my protector, my provider.
There’s so just so much you’ve done I can’t even recall it all. You have been everything I need and all that
I never deserved. Thank you for lavishing your love on me. Thank you for not casting me away from your
presence. Thank you for being longsuffering with me. Forgive me, Lord, for distrusting you and neglecting
the things you’ve assigned my hands to do. Strengthen me again and stir my passion once more Lord.
Father, I pray for those who are downcast, despondent, and in despair. Renew their faith and give them
fresh hope today. Set people free from the bondages of addictions and sin. Restore families and communi-
ties. Restore love, hope, passion, peace, and joy throughout the land. Let your truth ring out from every
sanctuary, every home, every school, and every neighborhood. Save our children from going down crooked
paths. Protect them from those who come to prey on them and pervert them. Let the light of your presence
permeate every dark place. In Jesus name, Amen.

## Can you give it all away? (2010-10-12 23:30)

I tend to be one that likes to hold onto things for far longer than necessary. You just never know when you
might need something. Yet, its rather easy to discard those things I count as trivial. But what about those
things in which we hold dear?

[1]

As I reflected upon Philippians 3:8, I noticed that Paul didnt mention not one tangible possession in the
preceding verses. Instead he spoke about pedigree, position, and passionate religious pursuits. All of which
could have easily lead to pride; however, he willing tossed it all aside. Trashing personal trinkets is often far
easier than doing away with the accolades of others, personal achievements, and positions of prestige.

Yes, all the things I once thought were so important are gone from my life. Compared to the high privilege of
knowing Christ Jesus as my Master, firsthand, everything I once thought I had going for me is insignificant
- dog dung. I’ve dumped it all in the trash so that I could embrace Christ. Philippians 3:8 (The Message)

Wanda - LOVED this! Sometimes it is SO hard to throw away the things you mentioned. However, lately, that’s one
thing I’ve been saying to the Lord - I just want to KNOW You. What a privilege to embrace Christ!!
Thanks for this reminder.
GOD BLESS!
(P.S. I have a hard time throwing personal trinkets away, too!!)

Wanda, this is so true... some people may not be owned by material possessions, but they are owned by their ego and
the adulation of others.
Powerful reminder, thank you. It seems He is speaking this type of message a few places I have visited lately in
blogland. He must want our attention on it.
God bless and thank you...

GlowinGirl (2010-10-13 04:12:17)
Great word, my friend! Isn’t it true that we hang on to things that we shouldn’t? Things that only tie us to this
world or to significance that isn’t true. May I be willing to cast it all aside just for Him... as He did for us.

ozjane (2010-10-13 05:59:49)
Very relevant in a week where I had to do a bio for a 50 yr teacher’s college reunion.
It was interesting to have someone comment on the parallel between my teaching life and life in the church.
Quite strange to see how others see you and the value they place on those silly status things...Nice but not to lean on.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-13 08:50:25)
A deep word, Wanda. I am often asked why I don’t have any awards, degrees, etc. on my office wall, and I tell people
the truth: I don’t want to get attached in the wrong way to the wrong things. One of my favorite movies, ”The House
of Sand and Fog”, is a blunt and brutal telling of detrimental attachments. It is a place that I never want to be.

MTJ (2010-10-13 11:27:32)
Hi Wanda,
Like you say, ”**it****s rather easy to discard those things I count as trivial.**” – _Those things I treasure are far_
_more difficult to toss out._ It’s those things I treasure that hinder my access to God.
God wants me to have access to Him; _a connected relationship that is always on._ This is a valuable lesson I’m learning,
surrendering my life, totally and completely to God. In doing so, I’m discovering that many of those things I once
treasured are nothing more than _dung._
Blessings and peace.

Peggy (2010-10-13 11:40:58)
Blessings Wanda... Powerful image & verse! I love your reflection on this and thoughts you shared! How specific you
addressed that Paul did not mention our possessions here in this verse of Philippians! Yet you hit this right where it
counts so wonderfully written:
”...about pedigree, position, and passionate religious pursuits”... which could easily lead to PRIDE
(written with tongue in cheek because I’m sure that is where it leads when we focus on material things):0( sorry, I
had to say it!
Excellent message and observation.
(I’m kinda a pack rat but moving here to Mexico forces me to at least leave my stuff behind and focus not on the
possessions any longer). The Message once again speaks this so well. Thank you!
I think all the recent natural disasters show us that we must let go of things and grab on to Jesus, as Our Rock! How
hard this is to say because many did not have much.
May God have mercy and hold back further destruction on us. May we wake up now... and take out our ”trash” and
let go of all that entwines us.
My soul is always well watered here. Thank you for stirring up what matters.

lori (2010-10-13 11:42:06)
Wanda, Wanda, Wanda...I don’t think it’s coincidence that I’m in the ”pride” chapter of ”Breaking Free!” This is a

Letting go of the things that I ”think” I need to treasure...yes indeed...that’s the mission!
Awesome reflection today girl! You always inspire!

One Heart (2010-10-13 15:52:03)
Beautiful sis. Passionate religious pursuits–some of the most difficult pride to get rid of and sometimes WE often
think the tangible and material possessions are the worst culprit. Yeah. I think I had mentioned something in line
with this a few days ago–about us having to lay down even the most spiritual and worthy causes if our Father saw any
tendency for pride in them. That is where trust comes in. Notice how Paul’s tendency to puff up came from spiritual

revelation. Now, we’d think anything coming from God would be an automatic green light to go but Paul points out
that he rather speak of his weaknesses.
This is great, and the best part is you present it with no condemnation lurking in the background. We can all fall so
easily. I am nothing apart from Christ.
Oh, and I saved you a cupcake. =D

Joan (2010-10-13 18:07:30)
Love this post, Wanda. So true, it is often hard to let go of pride, accomplishments, etc. As MTJ said, some things I

Christ.
Blessings,
Joan

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2010-10-13 18:22:10)
Hi Wanda,
Throwing away personal trinkets is definitely easier than some of the prideful trinkets we carry around.
I like the way you paired up the earth pulling me to itself (in my fall) to how our sins pull us to themselves. Thank
you for the encouragement to know they will lose their magnetic pull on us as we abide in Him.
Blessings,
Janis

## Just a Matter of Moments (2010-10-15 01:45)

```
[1][moments.jpg]
Photo via Flickr by [2]ktylerconk
```

Its the moments that matter most. Our lives are full of moments. Sometimes I think I lose focus that its
really all about the moment Im in at this time. Often, Im not feeling present but my mind is wandering
to next thing on my to-do list. Many moments have passed and the next moments arent promised to any
of us. Therefore, all I have is this present moment and how will I choose to spend it? If I squander all the
moments Im given, at the end of life, I will realize that it was not just moments I lost but my life wasted.
If the moments are really what matter, how do I make the present one count?
The time of pressure reveals what I given in exchange for the bulk of the moments of my life. Did I exchange
the moment for money? Or did I exchange it for folly? Was it trivial pursuits that consumed the most of
my moments? Or perhaps it was negative thoughts that I spent so many moments dwelling. Was idle words
and no activity that sucked away the moments of my life?
Forgive me Lord for failing to see the value in just this moment of my life. Show me how to take one moment
at a time and build a life that is pleasing to you-one that is according to your plan. I allowed the frustrations,
distractions, obligations, and pressures in life to lull me into sleep-filled activities without really choosing to
make the moment count.
I leave you with a few quotes:

You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have really lived are the moments
when you have done things in the spirit of love. - Henry Drummond

The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable,
unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to
step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers. - M. Scott Peck

Guard well your spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds. Discard them and their value will never
be known. Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life. - Ralph Waldo Emerson

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-10-15 01:55:52)

Yvonne.
```

```
MTJ (2010-10-15 04:20:29)
Hi Wanda,
I love how you ask questions that require answers. Too often, the questions one hears go ignored.
”If the moments are really what matter, how do I make the present one count?”
As I considered this one question (which spawned so many in my mind), here are my thoughts:
Moments are like the still images of a camera; slices of time. When moments are paired with a life, it takes on
something a camera cannot capture. There is a vibrance of life and color the lens cannot see, a smile, a gesture, a
conversation, a meeting of eyes; it is then that moments become a true part of one’s life.
Although I can’t reclaim any moment of my life, I can cherish those moments which I gave of myself to someone. I
can invest this moment I have in giving myself.
What I see is that my moments are never lost, they are invested. Some of my investments never produce a return and
they become forgettable and at times, regrettable. But those moments which bring me dividends are the moments
which are memorable.
I believe God blesses me with opportunities for memorable momentsand I’m most grateful to Him for them; I quietly
praise Him in this my moment.
Blessings and peace.

Sharon Kirby (2010-10-15 23:05:25)
Wanda - This was great. I have spent so much time (TOO much time) either regretting the past or worrying about
the future. God doesn’t call me to that! He gives me His daily bread - that’s what I think about when I think about
moments. God gives me THIS day, with its moments - it’s up to me to make them count.
I really liked the quote by Peck -
Lord, help me to ”step out of my rut” - help me to concentrate on making finer moments...
GOD BLESS!

MTJ, I love what you have shared but especially this one...moments are never lost, they are invested. Very profound
way to look at it. Just like making investment with our money, there are times the investment of our time is wise and
other times they are not. Rae oh me too. I don’t if it’s because I’m getting older or what but it seems that days go
by so fast and what my time here to matter.
Karen, Bluebutterfly, & Karen pleasure to have you ladies stop by.

## Not Without a Fight! (2010-10-18 11:29)

F I G H T&.thats not a word I like very much. I tend to avoid conflict like the plague. There are lots of
words one could use to describe me but fighter is not one likely to be included in the mix. But beneath the
quiet voice and laid-back persona lies another often unseen force. I myself got a small glimpse of it Sunday
morning when I found myself in a precarious position.

The day began like many others except that I stayed in bed later. As I was outside taking Bella for a potty
break, I looked up to discover an intruder was in our yard. And, we were on the wrong side of the fence. A
bulldog was in our yard growling and kicking up dirt at us. How were we to get back to the safety of the
house, if the dog was inside of our fence and the two entry ways were accessible to him? For what seemed
like an eternity but was actually just a few moments, I stood frozen in fear. How do I escape? How can I
get help without getting bitten? No neighbors in sight and no cell phone handy. No way I can out run the
dog. Do I leave my precious Bella as prey and try to escape myself?

A quick scan of my surroundings revealed only one dried up old stick. Armed with a stick and a prayer,
I made my move to cross the ditch in an effort to reach the closest entrance way. When I moved, the dog
moved too and charged out of the gate towards us. Needless to say that halted my movement but I raised my
voice saying NO and GET BACK and thats just what he did. I sounded like a crazy woman. Momentarily,
he was distracted by our nearby neighbors dog, which allowed us to make it to the safety of our steps.
Only to have him remember us and come charging back towards us full force. Luckily we did make it inside
without being hurt but that dog had the audacity to not just come in my yard but upon my porch. Now
Ive had similar incidents with dogs like the one I shared in [1]Shammah but the demeanor of this dog was
more vicious. And, this time around the dog invaded more of my personal territory.

Now you know after my heart stop racing and I had time to reflect upon the incident, I gleaned some lessons
from it.

• the enemy shows up when youre not alert and least expect it
• there are times when there is NO human assistance available
• when God is ALL youve got, thats enough to get the victory
• there is something down on the inside of me thats willing to fight to protect what belongs to me

• if God could protect me from a natural attack of a dog, there has to be many other things I havent
seen that Hes been keeping me shielded from
• some enemies, trouble, and circumstances you will have to face

Has the continual presence of a particular situation in your life threatened to take the fight out of you?
Failure to confront the enemy will only lead to a loss of more territory.

oh wow Wanda!! How scary! I could feel my heart racing as I read your post! I loved dogs dearly, but am afraid of
such dogs as this one you encountered.
Is that him in the photo? What happened in the end? Did he just leave, or someone come to get him? Don’t leave
us hanging like this! LOL! You had me on the edge of my seat, girl!
I love the message you got out of this terrifying situation. When there is no where else to turn or no one to help us,
we are positioned for His divine love and protection, Praise God.
Loved this post, or rather, the suspense, and the message.
Glad you and Bella are safe. And no, I doubt you would be the type to offer her up as the sacrifice to save yourself
(even if the thought did cross your mind, as it would mine). ;-)

MTJ (2010-10-18 14:36:22)

First, I thank God that both you and Bella were unharmed, safely escaping the attack of this dog.
As a child I was taught that dogs are 1) territorial, and 2) pack-oriented.
Territorial animals always look to establish a boundary perimeter belonging to them.
Pack-oriented animals will always seek to establish dominance over others in a group.
There are three ways to respond animals who display these actions, 1) You can be frozen by fear, this will usually
initiate an attack action.
2) You can take a submissive posture, yeilding to the dominance of the agressive animal.
3) You can take an agressive posture, indicating your willingness to fight and establish dominance over the animal.
This knowledge has always served me when I’ve be cornered by strange dogs. In some instances I’ve have to fight,
because dogs have a keen sense of smell and fear gives off a certain scent they detect; in those instances, I’ve had to
speak to that dog in a firm voice not to come forward as I took an agressive posture.
I’ve said all that to say that in the spiritual realm, I’ve been defeated and I’ve cowered from enemy attacks because I
didn’t understand the nature of that spiritual enemy.
I’m learning these tendencies now. I no longer fear when I hear what sounds like a lion’s roar. It’s a red flag for me
to take a stand and be prepared for spiritual battle.
Spiritual enemies are like dogs, they are territorial and they seek dominance. As a believer, Jesus has given me
authority stand and resist demonic powers and spirits. Armed with spiritual knowledge, the power and authority of
Jesus Christ, I will remain vigilant. There may be times when I’m not alert or unaware, but even in those instances,
I’m equipped for battle, I can call on the name of the Lord.
For some time now, I’ve been encouraged and inspired by your words, I thank God for you my sister.
Blessings and peace.

Dogs scare me!
I love this post my friend. It is fitting right now as the enemy is rearing his ugly head!
Thanks for the word!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-18 15:18:34)
Wanda, my soul is so touched. I spent some time in Judges meditating on Gideon this morning. There is no feeling
like when you have to face something and it just seems like there is no effective help. I thank God that He is never
useless and I thank Him even more for giving me the opportunity to put my trust in Him.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-10-18 16:10:02)
Just thankful all is well after an awful ordeal.
Yvonne.

Pat (2010-10-18 16:59:13)
Hi Wanda
I could only imagine the look on your face as the dog started to charge I had to smile,but I do thank God for protecting
you and Bella,beautiful dog too.It’s such a blessing to have God on our side at all times and to know that he is always
watching over us.Have a lovely day Wanda.
Love ya :)

Wanda (2010-10-18 17:54:57)
**Mike**, I have to be more alert too. Naturally I’m not very observant.
**Amanda**, I didn’t mean to leave you hanging...lol. Nope that’s not a photo of the actual dog but he looked very
similiar to that one. Trust me I know time or interest in taking a photo of that enemy...haha. It’s kind of funny who
the dog ended up belong too.
**MTJ**, I certainly hope I don’t encounter any more dogs but I’ll definitely be armed with this new knowledge you’ve
given me about 3 ways to react to them. Spiritually speaking I’ve lost many battles b/c of lack of knowledge and
failure to properly dressed for the battle. But thanks be unto God who gives us the victory.
**Beth**, victory already belongs to you my sister. No retreat, no defeat...was something God dropped in my spirit
several months ago.
**Bluebutterfly** having human support tends to make us feel better but having come out on the outside of a battle
with you & God surely increases one’s trust level.
**Yvonne** me too, my friend.
**Pat**, I can laugh it about now but I was terrified initially but acting like a wild woman in the end. Afterwards I
thought if the neighbors seen me they’d think i was crazy.

Arlee Bird (2010-10-18 18:21:40)
Despite our fear it’s best to keep a clear head and let God guide us. I try to face my fears with logic, trust in God,
and the knowledge that God has always provided me a way out in the past although I have to take action and do
what need to do.

I got goosebumps reading this! How scary. I love the insights you learned from an experience. God is protecting us
more than we can possible fathom!

Bernadine (2010-10-18 20:49:44)
I’m so happy that you and Bella are alright. It’s so awesome that out of this terrifying situation God had a word for
you to encourage us with today.

Dena E’s Blog (2010-10-19 03:20:44)

May you know God’s Love and His blessings from above Hugs across the miles and web Dena
Thanks for my note today!!!

B. Niles (2010-10-19 05:19:55)
Hi Wanda, what a beautiful blog. I love posts that come from every day experiences. They remind me of Jesus and
the parables. It’s life. There are lessons to learn from everything we go through on a daily basis. It makes me smile
at God. What a Daddy we serve!
It also reminds me of one of my favorite books that’s so simple. It’s called, A Turtle on a Fencepost, (Sub-titled,
Little Lessons of Big Importance) by Allan C. Emery.
Not without a fight! Though we don’t want to fight, it’s what strengthens us. Thank God we know 1) We do not
fight alone, 2)We have the power to overcome each battle, and 3) Ultimately, we win the war. Halellujah!
God Bless.
Beverly

lioneagle (2010-10-19 23:15:17)
Hi Wanda -
...loved this piece and how you told the story. And my heart leaped at how you responded. Hallelujah!
I had a similar experience with a dog. Here is an excerpt from my blog comment about it (The blog topic dtd October
14, 2010 was ”SPIRITUAL ENCOUNTERS WITH ANIMALS.”):
Excerpt:
One day I was alone in the kitchen with the two boxers and one of them just, ”out of the blue,” started barking and
would not stop. This was an ”unusual” barking episode. Usually, I could quiet him but this particular day, he was not
having it. Clearly, I heard the Lord speak in my spirit and tell me to take authority over the barking. He told me to,
with authority in my voice, tell the dog to ”shut up.” I said it with Holy Ghost fueled authority. I shouted, ”shut up”
and said the dog’s name. Immediately, I do mean immediately, the dog shut up.

BARBIE (2010-10-20 00:16:49)
I would have been terrified. So thankful you made it back to the house okay.

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-10-23 20:34:30)
Oh, I know I’m so late, but I’m so happy I got a chance to read this post. The lessons you gleaned from your encounter
with an ”enemy” were phenomenal and quite timely for myself. I just whispered, ”wow...”, as I read. Good word.

## A Never Ending Hope (2010-10-19 20:00)

I am as likely to reject my people Israel as I am to abolish the laws of nature! This is what the Lord says;
Just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth cannot be explored, so I will not
consider casting them away for the evil they have done. I, the Lord have spoken! Jeremiah 31:36-37 (NLT)

[1]
My One Year Bible has me reading through the book of Jeremiah currently. I am amazed that even though
Gods chosen people had forsaken Him and He was declaring judgment and punishment upon the people, the
book is still filled with hope. They would have to endure the season of bondage but change would eventually
come. Having been sentenced to 70 years of Babylonian captivity most would have counted these people out
and cast away any hope of brighter days for them. However, all was not lost for them and neither is it for
you and me. The same God, who was issuing the conviction sentence, proclaimed a future day of liberation.
Cast not away your hope for those you see still in bondage. Neither be dismayed about the areas of bondage
in your own lives. Our sovereign Lord is still turning hearts, destroying yokes, and saving souls. He continues
to accept the worlds rejects and castaways.

Peggy (2010-10-19 23:52:11)
Blessings Wanda... BEAUTIFUL graphic, the photo, the reflection, the verse! WOW! The Message was just as
powerful. Fills one with HOPE! and except that’s it’s late at night...I heard a shout over here...WOO HOO! HAL-
LELUJAH!!! PRAISE THE LORD!!!
”Our sovereign Lord is still turning hearts, destroying yokes, and saving souls!!! ”
”He continues to accept the worlds rejects and castaways.”
Thank You LORD!!!
Thanks Wanda... good WORD to fill my night with and my life!

Oh for the day when they will return to their God.

May you be blessed.

Amanda (2010-10-20 01:08:01)
I’m with Peggy! This is powerful!! It ministered to me, inspired me and gave me fresh hope for the things I still feel
in bondage with.
Thank You Lord, for Your word in season.
Great graphics Wanda. Great word.

MTJ (2010-10-20 02:17:00)
Hi Wanda,
I too am amazed by the grace of God poured lavishly upon us. I’m reminded of 1 Samuel 16:13, ”**Then Samuel**
**took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came**
**mightily upon David from that day forward.**” Later, David would write, ”**You have anointed my head with**
**oil;**” (_Psalm 23:5_).
The oil is symbolic of God’s grace, which He lavishly pours in, upon and throughout our lives.
So much can be said from this post you’ve written; _I’ll conclude with a hearty Amen!_
I lift you up before the Lord my sister, thanking Him for using you to touch hearts and illuminate the eyes; _you are_
_a blessing._
Blessings and peace.

Beautiful Wanda!

I am SO thankful that He still accepts the world’s rejects and castaways!! So thankful He was there to help me and
comfort me after so many years of ignoring Him and just pushing Him away!

GlowinGirl (2010-10-20 08:05:29)
I find this extremely encouraging. It seems to me that it is against God’s very nature to give up on us. Praising Him
for Who He IS!!

Angel @ Finding The Inspiring (2010-10-20 09:13:59)
I love the promises of God. His mercy is amazing! Thank you for this reminder. Joining you from a WFW. God bless
you!

Nic (2010-10-20 10:51:42)
It is so great to read other Christians who believe the same that God has not forsaken His chosen people! It seems so
many these day who claim the name ”Christian”, sadly, believe otherwise.
Great WFW!

Karen (2010-10-20 11:48:49)
Turning hearts and giving hope. :-)
That gives excitement!
Joining you at WFW.

it today...thanks for reminding me...SUCH encouragement! Smiles!!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-20 13:36:30)
Just reading this post brought joy to my heart. I loooooovvveeee Jeremiah. There is HOPE in our future, says the

Wanda...I have to tell you...THIS is crazy! I have had a slam packed day and this is the first chance I’ve had to visit
some of my faves...I’m heading out to Bible Study and thought I need to slooooooow down and prepare my heart...the
study is Breaking Free...Your post today just speaks volumes...no more bondage from whatever it is! Amen!
Awesome and sooo incredibly timely!!

Natalie at Mommy on Fire (2010-10-20 18:34:43)
Yes, don’t you love that it’s never too late? Beautiful words today and a great reminder, Wanda. Thank you.

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2010-10-20 19:20:02)
Wanda, thank you for these powerful and hopeful words. Praise God that He is still saving rejects and castaways.
That He will save those in bondage. That gives me hope for my loved ones!
Loved your photo/graphic. I have to learn how to do these things.
Blessings,
Janis

Wanda (2010-10-20 20:25:06)
Thanks ladies and gent for all the lovely thoughts you shared. Glad each of you found encouragement in these passages
as I did. As long as God is on the throne and people are among the living there’s always hope of change and freedom
in our lives. **Peggy** I can visualize your exuberant praise. It is indeed good news, my sister. **MTJ** thanks for your
prayers they’re much appreciated.**Nicole**thank goodness for God’s long suffering. Otherwise there be no hope for a
castaway like myself. **Angel, Nic, Karen** great to have you ladies stop over today. WFW is such a blessed way to
fill our cups with his Word as we visit & sip on His Words with others. **Bobbi** there’s a lot of proclaimed doom and
gloom in the book and at times I feel sorry for Jeremiah. He had assignment to fulfill that others didn’t welcome.
But even amongst the doom and gloom, I can see God’s patience and faithfulness with His people. **One Heart** no
worries my sister. **Lori**, you’re just a bucket of encouragement girl. Praise be unto Him for given you a dose of what
you needed.**Natalie** yes never to late. I think we need to do a better job of spreading that message of hope to the
lost. **Janis** I’ve just been playing around with some free photo editing software.

Amydeanne (2010-10-20 21:58:14)
what a powerful verse today Wanda!

jhunnelle (2010-10-20 23:37:56)
I just finished reading the book of Jeremiah, such a wonderful book it may be filled with distress, anger and punish-
ment but you can see the grace of God moving here.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful and powerful reflection.
Blessings!

us.Amen

What amazing verses are found in Jeremiah! Thank you for sharing.

Wanda (2010-10-23 21:29:33)
Blessings to each of you ladies. Yes there’s much encouragement in the book Jeremiah.

Dean Spencer (2010-10-25 21:46:15)
Wanda -
Very well said. God has not forsaken us. It may seem like the world is taking over and evil is running rampant. But
that kind of thinking forgets that God is still in control. Like you said, _”Our sovereign Lord is still turning hearts,_

```
destroying yokes, and saving souls.
Amen and amen! God bless!

## The Waiting ̃ Blog Tour (2010-10-20 08:00)

[1] Its my pleasure to take part in the blog tour for Suzanne Woods Fishers
latest release, The Waiting. Not only was this my first acquaintance with Ms Fishers writing but also my
first time reading Amish fiction. But after reading this book, its unlikely to be my last.
Although the main storyline revolves around Jorie King, a young Amish maiden, waiting for her beloved
Benjamin Zook to return home from the Vietnam War, the book is filled with characters that are in a wait
of their own. Waiting to be free. Waiting to die. Waiting to love again. Waiting to be understood. Waiting
to be accepted despite ones skin color. As anyone who has experienced the wait between ones dream and
its manifestation knows things dont always go as planned. And, the Amish are no exception. Readers are
taken along alongside Jorie, Caleb, Ben, Matthew, Ephraim, and Maggie as they try to make sense of their
changing world through the eyes of their faith. The Waiting drew me in from the very first page and as I
turned the last page, I long to stay a little longer at Beacon Hollow.
The Waiting include scenarios most individuals could easily relate to like:

• A single father struggling to make a living and raise two children on his own, while battling grief.
• An African American veterinarian facing prejudice and opposition in the 1960s.
• People of faith attempting to balance being in the world but not becoming a part of the world.
• A young man seeking to find his own identify and place in the world outside of the confines of the
expectations of others.
• A family facing the reality of Alzheimers disease

From the back cover: Jorie Kings life is on hold. She has been waiting for Ben Zook to return to Lancaster
County. Waiting for him to settle down and join the church. Waiting to marry him.
But when news arrives that Ben have been killed, Jorie is devastated. She finds unlikely comfort in the
friendship of his brother Caleb. Friendship ripens into love, and two broken hearts plan for a life filled with
the promise of a fresh beginning  until their worlds are turned upside down.
About the author:

Suzanne Woods Fisher is the CBA bestselling author of The Choice,[2]

The Waiting, Amish Peace, and Amish Proverbs. Her interest in
the Anabaptist cultures can be directly traced to her grandfather, WE. D. Benedict, who was raised in the
Old Order German Baptist Brethren Church in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Benedict eventually
became publisher of Christianity Today magazine. Suzanne is the host of a radio show called Amish
Wisdom and her work has appeared in many magazines. She lives in California. Find out more about

book. Best wishes to you.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-20 19:34:33)
Thanks Wanda. This post is my reminder that I need to download a few books to read. I also heard very positive
reviews on Amish fiction on NPR recently.

I have read a few Amish fiction books and enjoyed them.

I think I’ll enter the contest.

Wanda,
This sounds great; There is a rhythm and a peaceful feeling, sometimes when we enter another lifestyle. Sometimes...
I do think we often feel the grass is greener elsewhere.
Thanks for sharing; Sounds like a great read!

Suzanne (2010-10-25 20:02:24)
Hi Wanda!
I hope you’re thinking of wirting a book! You’ve got a beautiful way with words...I really mean that! Loved your

description of the ”waiting” of the characters in this story. Really lovely eye-for-detail!
I’m a little late on popping by...I was out of town helping my daughter last week with her new baby, and am at my
publisher’s right now. But I had a few minutes to spare and wanted to thank you for your review of ”The Waiting.”
Thrilled you want to read more! ”The Search” is coming in about 6-7 weeks!
Thanks, Wanda, for being a part of the tour, too.
Warmly, Suzanne Woods Fisher

## The Artist (2010-10-24 13:47)

As I walk this morning and look up at the sky, I can’t help but be awestruck by the wonder of your hand-
iwork. There are many talented artist but you far exceed them all. Never have I seen such colors like the
ones in which you paint across the sky.

[1]

Each morning that I awake, there is a fresh new tapestry of color weaved into the beauty of a brand new day.
Even as the night consumes the light of day, I see the evidence of your fingerprint there. I may never be able
to see Michelangelo’s paintings but may a never become so busy that I fail to appreciate the masterpieces
I’m able to behold with my eyes every day.

Thank you, Wanda. Whenever counsel kids I always remind them that they were created a masterpice and all they
need to do is build up from there. I guess we adults need to keep that in mind also.

Rae, thanks and same to you.

I like to see what you make of Its no Secret!

Laura @ I’m Booking It (2010-10-25 23:47:13)
You’ve got some great looking books there– I love the cover on the first one in particular!

LisaShaw (2010-10-25 23:52:24)
Hey Wanda, how are you sis?
Looks like you have a bit of reading on your hands (smile). I so want to get Rachel’s book.
I have quite a few at my bed posts I’m in the middle of or have not begun reading. Too many to list but the one I’m
most enjoying right now is PRAYER by Philip Yancey.
Hugs and blessings as you enjoy your reading! Love this time of year for reading especially. Curl up with hot coffee
or hot cider, a blanket and a good book oh and something snack like (smile).

Dena E’s Blog (2010-10-26 02:58:06)

Hey Sis”
thinking of you
As you trust in Him
May the light of our Savior Jesus Christ continue to shine through you Sweetie!!!
Hugs Dena

Amused (2010-10-26 02:59:26)
What a fun group of books! I really like the look of the first one. Enjoy all of your new reads.

jewelknits (2010-10-26 04:19:00)
It’s No Secret looks fantastic judging by the cover alone, and I was very surprised to read a review of A Million Ways
to Die, The Only Way to Live as it did NOT seem to fit the picture on the cover! Enjoy your reads!
Julie @ Knitting and Sundries

Wanda (2010-10-26 11:04:07)
Mystica, I’m enjoying it thus and far and will be writing a review of it soon.
Laura and Amused, that cover does look so inviting doesen’t?
Lisa, you mean I’m not the only one attempts to read several books at a time?
Dena, I so appreciate your nice sentiments. Last night was a bit of downer for me but to wake and see such nice
thoughts has brighten my morning. Blessings to you.
Jewelknits, the cover of books are the first thing that grabs my attention. Sounds like I might be in for a bit of surprise
with A Million Ways to Die.

Holly (2 Kids and Tired) (2010-10-26 18:47:46)
I’ve got It’s No Secret too. I can’t wait to get to it. Enjoy your books!

avisannschild (2010-10-28 01:08:04)
The cover for _A Million Ways to Die_ is very similar to the one for _Stiff_ by Mary Roach! Welcome to Mailbox Monday
and enjoy all your books!

## Flourish (2010-10-26 04:02)

Dr. Catherine Hart Webers latest release, [1] Flourish: Discover the Daily Joy of
Abundant, Vibrant Living offers women the tools necessary to move from a life of mere existence. She ushers
us away from the fast-paced, no-time-for-me kind of life and implores us to take time to really examine our
livelihood. Does it reflect the abundant life Christ came to give us as believers? In Flourish, Dr. Weber uses
a Biblical centered psychological approach in teaching readers how to lay hold of more joy, peace, hope and
fruitful relationships.
I found that the book was a slow read for me. Not because it was uninformative or disinteresting but rather
the questions for reflection and other practical advice contained in the book made me want to take my time
in digesting the material. Although the book is specifically stated to be for women, I think anyone could
benefit from not just reading the book but applying it.
What I like about the book:

• provides practical exercises to apply the truths discussed
• combines Biblical truth with medical research without being overly technical

Quotes I liked:

```
Did you know that you can actually spread and catch the emotions of the people around you,
like you can catch a cold?
```

Couldnt we all think of someone, who has a way of letting the air out of our good day, when they come
around coughing out complaints and criticisms?

```
Overindulging yourself in what may seem temporarily pleasurable can lead to unhappiness.
```

```
In current evangelical Christian life, often the opportunity to go deeper with God in the dark
moments of our life is missed, mainly because people too quickly run away from dark times and
try to grab hold of surface joys and comforts.
```

The views and opinions expressed are my own.

```
Will Burke (2010-10-26 04:38:05)
I’m getting a rare indulgence right now: Up early, so I’m reading Blogs with a coffee while the baby sleeps, and having
a delightful time!
```

```
Wanda (2010-10-26 06:10:10)
Will, I can imagine with a little one it’s not one that you have much opportunity to overindulge in so enjoy :)
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-26 07:07:55)
Complaints and criticism...like having a doctor repeatedly tell you what is wrong without ever offering a solution.
Will make any day or diagnosis worse.
```

```
One Heart (2010-10-26 07:50:28)
Sounds like a good one, Wanda. I like what Bluebutterfly wrote...so very true. I can so see how sometimes we are
tempted to grab on to surface joys while experiencing dark times of trials. It’s the ”get me outta here” syndrome of
human nature. But true joy runs way deeper. Thanks for sharing and for stopping by too.
```

```
Joanne Sher (2010-10-26 08:26:33)
Sounds lovely and encouraging, Wanda. Thanks!
```

```
Sharon Kirby (2010-10-26 19:12:10)
Wanda,
This sounds like a really good book. Have to go check it out. I really liked the final quote - how true. I often find
myself trying to AVOID difficult times. I want God to FIX the circumstances, instead of TRANSFORMING me. I
want my version of peace (freedom from anxiety) instead of His (total trust and rest in His wisdom and His ways...)
Thanks for sharing - GOD BLESS!
```

```
Ellen aka Ella (2010-10-26 20:54:02)
Thanks for sharing; Yes, over indulgences in chocolate results in not being happy with my hips! lol
Sounds like a great soul searching read xXx

## Slipping Away (2010-10-26 23:00)

[1]

Headed out the door and down the steps, I found myself drifting downward towards an unexpected and
unwanted dirt kiss, if I wasnt able to do something fast. Too late to completely stop the nose dive, I reached
for the car in an effort to brace myself for the fall. Luckily my whole body didnt hit the concrete only one
knee was scratched. Having gone down those steps many times, how did I manage to slip that day? In my

haste, I missed the bottom step. The step hadnt changed locations, it was I who failed to properly maneuver
it.
Is that not how life can be at times? Were residing in the same location yet something seems to have changed
or slipped away. At least that is how I find my life at times. Living in the same house, working the same job,
attending the same church, a member of the same family and participating in the same activities but things
that I maneuvered so well in the past now feel as if Ive misstep. Have you ever felt yourself slipping away?
There are days that my passion ebbs away. Other times I notice Ive slipped into complacency, complaining,
discontentment, or depression. But, why? In most case its because I have allowed my focus to slide away
from the one who is my ultimate support. He has not moved and its comforting to know that all I have
to do is call out to Him. I can share my true feelings with Him; theres no need to conceal my inner most
thoughts.
Psalms 94:18-19 (NLT) I cried out, I am slipping! but your unfailing love, O Lord, supported me. When
doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer.

```
Amanda (2010-10-26 23:46:50)
Wonderful perspective with that scripture Wanda! It is so true... nothing has to change in our lives, but our hearts
shift a gear and we can lose ground and slip. Scraped knees are never very nice! Quite painful in fact!
I do hope yours isn’t too painful... but what a beautiful lesson to learn from it all.
```

```
GlowinGirl (2010-10-27 03:59:41)
Have I ever felt myself slipping away? Yes, unfortunately. And just as you said, nothing else significant had changed
in my life.... but me and my position. He is faithful, though, just as you pointed out, and I’m so thankful for His
steady, loving support!
```

```
Michele Williams (2010-10-27 04:44:01)
Yes, I have felt that way at times... I am so glad the Lord is always there to catch me... Blessings..
```

```
Joan (2010-10-27 05:05:09)
Wanda, this post really spoke to me. It is so easy to become complacent and discontent. I am so thankful that we
can share our inner most thoughts with God and He truly understands - not condemning, but loving us (in spite of
ourselves).
Blessings,
Joan
```

```
Joanne Sher (2010-10-27 07:31:11)
Soooo been there, Wanda. LOVIN this reminder.
```

```
Brian the old man (2010-10-27 07:42:59)
I have been through so much in my life and knowing He is there to pick me up and carry me through all of the slips
and falls has truly made me blessed.
```

Kaye Swain - SandwichINK (2010-10-27 07:48:07)
What wonderfully encouraging Bible verses! I’m extra tired today AND praying lots for a couple of beloveds who are
struggling so I will be Scripture praying these for all of us. Thank you! :)

Carole in the UK (2010-10-27 07:51:37)
Wanda, I most certainly have been at the place you describe so beautifully. I now sense when I am slowly sliding back
to that place.
It is when I hear myself complaining and being critical of those things which I was quite happy about previously, but
now hear a critical inward voice.
I am so glad that I serve a God who understands when we share our innermost thoughts with Him.
God Bless You More.

lori (2010-10-27 07:52:08)
GIRL this was SOOO good! It’s the reason we recently left the church we were at...slipping...slipping into complacency
is what happens. We get a little too comfortable in where we are and sometimes the ”face plant” is exactly what we
need! :) This was SOOOO good!
peace Wanda!
you rock!
lori

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-10-27 08:40:56)
Yes, Lord...Yes, Lord. So many times I found myself in that place and had to get myself a ”Word” check.

Angel @ Finding The Inspiring (2010-10-27 11:02:54)
I love this! So good to know we can call on Him when we feel ourselves slipping. He is faithful! Blessings to you.

Sandy (2010-10-27 12:14:24)
Hi Wanda,
First time here. Love your
good words of encouragement.
Joining you as we follow
Him.
God bless,
Sandy

Peggy (2010-10-27 13:54:01)
Blessings Wanda... WOW! WOW! WOW!
Great message and Word!!! Sorry about your slip...hope it was not recent but if so that you are on the mend.
Healing from His hands and strength to Support you always! The truth in your analogy was so powerful and very
convicting in a good way. I was ministered to as you shared.
As I cry out, when I feel that I may be slipping, I’m so thankful for His unfailing love, for His comfort, for my hope
renewed, for the ”Hip, hip, hooray” cheer, I hear from His sweet whisper as we press on and keep our feet on solid
ground. When you keep it REAL like this, I am humbled and know that He is our FOCUS and our PEACE, our
ultimate support! He does not move!
Thank you Wanda!!!
Peace,
Peggy

Karen (2010-10-27 14:06:10)
Great verse. Bless you, Wanda.

Sharon Kirby (2010-10-27 17:35:46)
Wanda - What a great word. Thank you. Yes, I have had times of BIG slipping -wandering away from God’s pathways.
And times of ”little” slipping (is there really any such thing??) - times when I just lost sight and got discouraged.
However, PRAISE THE LORD! Slipping doesn’t always mean falling, and even when it does, HE helps us get back
up, dusts us off, and says, ”Take heart...I have overcome...”
GOD BLESS!

Karen (2010-10-27 18:44:17)
Wow...I got dizzy just looking at that picture...glad your ”slip” didn’t do much damage...
My spiritual slips have done damage...but praise the Lord...His hand is always near and His mercies are always new....

Faith Imagined (2010-10-27 20:12:01)
I can relate to every single one of your posts! Satan sure knows how to use our complacency to his advantage.

Lorena G. Sims (2010-10-28 01:35:18)
Yes! I have found myself slipping away many times. But it is comforting to know that we have God who we can lean
on to.

Ozjane (2010-10-28 04:01:45)
Ouch.....I can identify with that one whilst appreciating the graphic and verse.
I managed to fall onto my knees in the bedroom.....so thankful for carpet but being on my replaced knees is a little
like being on a bed of nails. Had some great bruises....
But He kept me from hitting cabinets and so I am most grateful.

Guiding Light (2010-10-28 07:48:09)
Great post - and a great reminder! Have a wonderfully blessed day!

PatriciaW (2010-10-28 10:30:16)
Whenever I feel as though something’s a little off, maybe I’ve slipped, I’m reminded that God is constant. He hasn’t
moved and He doesn’t slip. So it must be me, and I’m inspired to find my way back to gripping His hand more tightly.

Pat (2010-10-28 12:13:54)
Hi Wanda
Those days do make you feel horrible,but as you said it’s so important to stay focused.Today is one of those days for
me ”yuck” just feeling blah,blah,blah!!! I thank God it want last.Wonderful post Wanda.

Saija (2010-10-28 13:30:02)
good posting ... and i love the psalms you used - one of my favourite reminders that God is always there to hear my
cry and lift me up!
blessings on you!

Beth E. (2010-10-28 20:11:01)
A wonderful post, Wanda! It felt as if you were speaking directly to me...have you been looking over my shoulder? ;-)
Just wanted to stop by and visit your blog...I’m so glad I did! Thank you, again, for visiting mine.

Cathy (2010-10-28 20:38:10)

Elizabeth West (2010-10-29 09:28:31)
Great post, Wanda. Maybe I need to try using that phrase. I seem to feel lately that my communications are not
being heard.
Anyway it made me feel a bit better. Thanks. :)

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2010-10-31 16:18:45)
Isn’t it amazing that three of us have fallen (you, Sharon, and myself), and that the Lord has taught each of us a
different lesson from the fall.
I love your post on slipping into complacency with our walk with the Lord. It happens too easily. Just as slipping
into complacency with our loved ones. It’s too easy to take people for granted the Lord’s love included.
Blessings,
Janis

## Got Questions for You (2010-10-30 20:14)

Well I finally made it back to my blogging home. Ive been out of town for the past few days. As I was
pondering what to write next here, I discovered I was tagged by Chelle at [1]Chasing the Divine. No need to
rack my wandering brain any longer when Id been provided an easy prompt to get the juices flowing again.
So heres something light for Saturday. Rules are to answer 8 questions and then make up 8 questions of my
own and tag 8 of you lucky readers.

And now, for my Q & A from Chelle.

1. What will you be dressing up as for Halloween?

Hmmm&.I guess you can say a Sunday School teacher since tomorrow is Sunday and thats about the only
dressing up Ill be doing.

2. What would the title of your autobiography be?

Oh my, now I thought this was going to be easy. First thing that comes to mind is Between Sisters since I
spent years being the middle girl or In Pursuit of Self.

3. If you could acquire any one skill, what would it be?

I wish I had the gift of gab. I tell my mom I dont know how she ended up with a child like me seeing as she
never meets a stranger.

4. You have your choice of living anywhere in the country world, where would it be?
Maybe some where on a tropical island.
5. You have 1 million dollars you must donate to charity, which charity do you choose?
Just one? One whos mission was serving rural underprivileged children.
6. What achievement are you most proud of?

Oh golly am I suppose to toot my own horn? Id say being brave enough to leave a career I wasnt happy
with and go back to school despite hearing all the I cant believe you dont like &. from others.

7. What makes you laugh the hardest?

The things Madea has the audacity to say on Tyler Perry movies.

8. What is your favorite snack food?

Chocolate chip cookies

And heres where the fun begins for you, if you choose to participate. Here are my eight questions?

1. What is your favorite season?
2. What phrase do you find yourself saying like your parents, although you thought youd never be caught
repeating such words?
3. What was your first or favorite Christmas gift that you received?
4. Which are you more likely to do: sing karaoke, bungee jump, or speak to a large crowd?
5. When driving do you go the speed limit, just a wee bit over the limit, or make sure you just a little bit
under the speed limit?
6. Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to your younger self?
7. Besides the Bible, what book has had a great impact on your life?

Chelle (2010-10-30 20:23:14)
WEll done! I am so with you on Madea, I completely agree!!
Thanks for playing along :)
```

```
Sharon Kirby (2010-10-30 21:19:50)
Thanks for the tag, Wanda.
Here’s my answers:
```

1. My favorite season? Summer, for sure. Love the sun!
2. Phrase from my parents? My dad always used to say, ”Can I make a suggestion?” and then proceeded to tell me
(nag me) to do something. My 20-something sons are overjoyed that this now comes out of MY mouth. (It used to
be ”Because I told you so.”)
3. Favorite Christmas gift? Probably a miniature, Barbie-sized kitchen. The stove actually turned a miniature
”turkey” - the sink had a hose that made actual water come out of the faucet - and the refrigerator had all this
miniature food. Loved it - because I wanted it so bad, and I got it - even though my mom had ”said” it was too
expensive!
4. More likely to do? Speak to a large crowd. For some odd reason, I would actually LOVE to do this.
5. Speed limit? Truth??? I have a bit of a ”lead foot” - I drive OVER the speed limit.
6. Advice to younger self? Run away from that one relationship that caused so much grief.
7. Which book had the greatest impact? Actually, it was ”The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe” by C.S. Lewis.
Why? Because it made me FEEL the crucifixion for the first time in my young life. And it introduced me to my
favorite writer of all time.
8. Bucket list? Go to Scotland. Both of my grandmothers were born there. Would love to visit the country of my
kilted kinsmen!
Thanks, Wanda - this was fun.
Have a refreshing Sunday...and GOD BLESS!

words?
In my house. Put any thing in the blank but is is usually about what needs to be done or
shouldn’t be done.
What was your first or favorite Christmas gift that you received?
An answer to prayer. Last year I didn’t have dime to get my son anything. Since is is just the two of us I told

Don’t have sex until your married you will regret it. Oh and go to college.

Stuff could always be worse (2010-10-31 17:35:43)
Thanks again, for the design...and the tag! I will play the game?? Hope I can make sense...
kim

Wanda (2010-10-31 19:16:16)
Oh, my pleasure Chelle.
Sharon, thanks for joining the fun. I have a bit of a lead foot too. One of my favorite gift was a rose petal doll house
I got. My mom looked every where to ensure I that request was granted.
Oh sorry Nicole. I didn’t realize you’d been it before. No worries if you don’t decide to tag anyone else. It’ll be our
secret.
Joanne, lol....I understand. Hmmm...maybe next time, though.
Analisa, what a powerful testimony of how God answered your prayer. He’s concerned about every detail of our lives.
I haven’t read either one of those books but I did really enjoy Kingdom Agenda by Tony Evans, which I read several
years ago.
Kim, you’re very welcome. Glad you liked it and I look forward to reading your answers.

Dena E’s Blog (2010-10-31 19:36:21)

What a fun read Wanda....Just wanted to stop by and say HEY atcha” ”Hey” Sis” thinking of you...

A little prayer for you As you trust in our Sweet Lord” may He continue to shine through you covering you with
His blessings too...

I love your answer to the first question. :-) Cool.

Amanda (2010-11-01 02:32:37)
Wanda, I loved reading your answers and learning a little more about you!
I had never heard of those Madea movies, until I went to the States last year. Our lovely host hired out a few of them
and we really enjoyed them!
Bless ya sister!

Amanda (2010-11-01 02:33:09)
oh!! ps!!
I know of the perfect tropical island haha! Right near me ;)

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-01 11:00:22)
Great answers and questions. My favorite book besides the Bible that changed my life was...I can’t choose between
Far From The Madding Crowd and Jane Eyre. I started reading at a very young age and read both these books in
one Summer. I think I learned that there was more to people than what was on the surface and that I should look
beyond the surface always.

Wanda (2010-11-01 15:57:44)
Dena, thank you!!
Ok Ellie, I look forward to reading your answers. Take Care.
Petula, thanks.
Amanda, Madea is quite a character. Oh I like the sound of that island. I’ve seen all the beautiful pictures you’ve
shared.
Bluebutterfly, sounds like very wise lesson you learned. Kind of like you can’t judge a book by it’s cover.
Thanks to all of you for stopping by and sharing your thoughts.

LisaShaw (2010-11-01 16:07:24)
Wanda, I’m with you on Madea!
I didn’t know you were a Sunday School Teacher. That’s awesome!
I learned a little bit more about you in this sharing. I like that!
Hugs!

”Let me tell you about my modesty.” - Jason’s adaptation of a line from ’Fiddler on the Roof’

## 1.9 November

## Despite Whats Seen (2010-11-01 21:40)

[1] Joanne at An Open Book has selected an obscure verse in one of the less
popular books of the Bible for todays Monday Manna discussion. But even in the most unlikely places one
can find treasure. Besides, how many really valuable things have you discovered just lying around in plain
view? I digress sorry. Todays scripture is from Habakkuk 3:17-18 and honestly I cant recall ever reading
this particular passage.

_Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the_
_fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in_
_the LORD, I will be joyful in God my Savior._

Less Than Ideal Circumstances

[2] As I read this verse it immediately reminded me of
another passage of scripture I had read recently in chapter 3 of Lamentations, which reads, The thought of
my suffering and homelessness is bitter beyond words. I will never forget this awful time, as I grieve over my
loss. Yet I still dare to hope when I remember this: The faithful love of the Lord never ends! His mercies
never cease. Just as when I read that passage during my daily reading, I was drawn to the stark contrast
of the writers environmental condition to his internal condition. Neither writer was suffering from denial
or delusion. Each presented a clear description of just how dismal their current situation was in fact. A
situation that was:

• without growth
• void of productivity

• vastly different from times past
• appeared to have no end in sight

An Atypical Response

Yet, their response in the situation was not the most logical one from a natural perspective. Amidst death,
barrenness, destruction, lack and great loss, Jeremiah stated he still had hope and Habakkuk said he was
still choosing to have joy. Hope and joy are not the by-products of loss are they? Having lost a few things in
my life, I certainly dont think so. Although, Ive never suffered loss to the magnitude as these two but loss
is loss. And, I certainly know what it feels like to be in a place of no outward sign of growth or productivity
without the benefit of knowing when the situation would change.

Did these two possess some special ability beyond the reach of us average Christians? I think not but rather
they chose to use what many of us (or Ill just say what I) often neglect when facing dire circumstances. It
all boiled down to the power of one choice-the choice of where to apply their focus. Though acknowledging
the reality of their situation, they chose instead to focus on God  his character and their past experience
Him.

Are you looking at some spots of death, lack, or non-productivity in your life? If so, I offer you the same
challenge Im giving myself. Dare to change your focus. Even though facing situations beyond our control,
there still remains one controllable choice.

What does Habakkuk 3:17-18 speak to you?

LisaShaw (2010-11-01 22:05:01)
Wanda,
You said it well! We have a choice. A choice to focus on the problem(s), the loss, the trial, the betrayal, the hurt,
the situation, the illness, etc. OR we can choose to put our focus on the LORD and when we do there is a peace that
surpasses all understand...a joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, a strength that arises within us for it is not by
might nor by power but strictly by His Spirit that we are able to keep our eyes on HIM.
For me Wanda it’s reminding myself of what I already know...I am persuaded that HE is and that He’s able to keep
me fully and completely and so I am determined to keep my eyes fixed on HIM, my feet firmly rooted in His Word
and my heart completely washed in His love and though I FAIL often I’m glad the Holy Spirit gets me back on track
quickly!
Love you friend!
```

```
Stuff could always be worse (2010-11-01 22:19:54)
This spoke to me, even during stress or troubles, I will keep His Joy! These two in the Bible did have it worse but
kept the Joy.

Joanne Sher (2010-11-01 23:35:11)
Wonderful insights, Wanda. I hadn’t thought about the parallel to Jeremiah, but it is SO clearly there! That’s why I
love reading other people’s perspectives. Thanks for participating!

lioneagle (2010-11-01 23:39:02)
Hi Wanda -
This is excellent.
That Habakkuk verse has long been one of my favorites though I use the KJV.
You so well expressed those truthful sentiments.
Thank you, Wanda!

Pat (2010-11-01 23:45:05)
Hi Wanda you used my favorite scripture here Habakkuk 3:17 18 I truly love that scripture and it gives me such hope
when going through tough times,so many Christians have been taught suffering is not a part of God’s will,but when
you look closer you’ll see that it is,God does more through out trials than any other way.God has it all planned out
all we have to do is trust him and wait.Really good I enjoyed the read.

Just Be Real (2010-11-02 08:17:25)
This post spoke volumes to me Wanda. Could not be such a perfect timing as this. Thank you. Blessings.

Amanda (2010-11-02 08:29:40)
Wanda, timely for me also... thank you ago for the ’realness’ in your writing which comes from your heart.

TonyR (2010-11-02 13:20:04)
Wanda,
Very well written. Habakkuk 3:17-18 is one of my favorite passages of hope in the Bible.
WOW I LOVE the wording of this version of Lamentations 3, it was a fresh word for my soul. Lamentations 3: 21-26
is also a favorite passage but I have never read this version before. What version is this from?
Thank you

Hi Wanda,
Grace and peace!!!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-02 16:04:25)
Habakkuk is one of my favorite books in the Bible. Our response is what matters most, and how we respond should
reflect what what is on the inside. On the inside should be the Joy of the Lord, which is our strength. On the inside
should be the Hope in the Lord, which is our confidence.
Yet, I will rejoice...yet, I will hope...yes, I will believe in the God of my salvation. Thanks, Wanda.

Guiding Light (2010-11-02 16:07:35)
Yet I will rejoice in the Lord - AMEN! Have a wonderfully blessed day!

B. Niles (2010-11-02 16:23:43)
The Word of God is so poetic, beautiful and powerful. I can’t recall ever reading that verse in Habakkuk either,
Wanda. But I love it’s rendering.
It takes me back to Hebrews 11:1. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. No
matter what things look like in our circumstances, can we still see God at work. The external vs. the internal.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-11-02 22:31:44)
A wonderful post to read Wanda.
I would like to thank you for all the support you have shown me.
I really do appreciate it.
Yvonne.

Nicole (2010-11-02 22:52:47)
Beautiful Wanda!! Thanks for posting about these 2 wonderful verses! It is so hard sometimes to remember in our
hard times, time of loss or other hard times that God will never leave us and He will always supply our needs, though
they may not be what we are thinking or hoping for at the time He will leave us! and what He has in store for us is
always whats best!

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-03 02:44:30)
Wanda,
God does indeed work in mysterious ways. My post on Sunday (www.biblepickems.blogspot.com) was about these
very same verses!! It’s interesting to me, because I ”randomly” pick verses to write about on Sundays. Makes me
think God has something to say He wants us to hear!
I used the NLT for the verses. Habakkuk uses the phrase, ”even though” - and then he finishes with ”yet I will.”
I found that this was a new insight to me - a change of focus as you have said. God can change any ”even though”
circumstance - even though the worst is happening - into a choice to turn to Him in trust and peace - ”yet I will”
CHOOSE to rejoice.
Thanks for your input on these very special verses.
GOD BLESS!

Julie (2010-11-03 04:15:44)
Wanda,
Sometimes life is just plain hard... the thorns and thistles of this broken world come after you... and it still comes
back to one thing. ”Is God really good?” At least that’s what it is for me. I cannot trust in what I see God doing or
not doing. I can only trust in who He is.
I know you’ve seen where I’ve been. These verses really spoke to me tonight. Thank you for sharing them and thank
you for your beautiful words left at my blog.
Bless you,
Julie

Carole in the Uk (2010-11-03 04:23:53)
Yeah, Wanda, one of my very favourite verses - it is so powerful!
I love to meditate on this verse, as it gives me so much strength, when I am struggling in any area of my walk with
the Lord.
It immediately reminds me of the Psalms of David. As I study them, I notice that his Psalms were like a spiritual
diary. That because of his personal relationship with God, he was able to pour out his raw emotions, warts and all.

Holding nothing back. He had the ability to question God about his circumstances, asking the why question, repenting
of the wrong he had done, and knowing fully well, that God was in control of his life.
As I read the Psalms he wrote, I also notice that however dire the situation, David always finished his Psalms by
rejoicing in the Lord.
Thank you for your article,
God bless, Carole

Wanda (2010-11-03 21:18:06)
Wow, I’m amazed that so many of you had this passage of scripture as a favorite. It’s a book I’ve read before but the
verse about writing the vision and making it plain is the one that stands out the most to me from this book. As you
can see I’m no Bible scholar...lol. It’s certainly an encouraging passage of scripture because we all face tough times
at some point in our lives. Yet God remains good. Tony, Lamentations is quoted from the NLT version. Sharon, I’ll
have to check that out. I’ve found we I see a recurring theme, it’s definitely something I need to pay closer attention
too. Thanks ladies for sharing your thoughts and may God continue to bless and keep you.

## Sleep But No Rest (2010-11-02 23:00)

[1]

So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest. Hebrews 3:19 (NLT)

Perhaps it was the night of interrupted sleep due to the neighbors barking dog during the wee hours of the
night that caused this passage of scripture to stand out as I read it this morning. But last night is not the
only night that rest has eluded me. Sleep and rest are not necessarily synonymous. Despite the sheet thread
count, type of bed, or even the room the bed is located, true rest can only be found in one place.

As I meditated upon the scripture, I was reminded or better yet warned about all the times I find myself
anxious and fretting over various things in my life. The true cause of this state of unease is unbelief. No
matter what clever sounding statements I tried to cloak it in, the reason came back to unbelief that God
would handle this area. I mean I know that He can but can I trust Him to fix it in a way thats good and
pleasing to me. Sounds rather shallow, huh, but it is true anyway. And, only in acknowledging it could I
receive the help that I really need. I dont want to be self-deceived and I want to truly trust Him so that I
might receive not just sleep but true rest.

What a great verse to share. Thank and be blessed!

hip-chick (2010-11-03 03:03:28)
When I am worried about something and I can’t sleep I find that turning my heart towards God, praying and giving
my worries to God comforts me.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-11-03 03:04:35)
I agree a wonderful verse,
Have a wonderful day,
Yvonne.

ozjane (2010-11-03 04:48:12)
I agree there is only one who gives ultimate rest.
However can I suggest a couple of practical things that God has shown me and has helped my insomnia.
One if a diary in which I briefly put down the events of the day and unload my mind. I normally follow this with
my prayer book/list...so that my mind is focused on His word and on those He has laid on my heart to bring to the
throne of Grace.
The other thing I do is take quite a lot of magnesium and calcium at night. I very much notice it when I do not take
it.
I would never want these comments to take away from His rest...but He does promise to give His beloved sleep, so I
feel at peace to pass on some of what I have learned (in my old age...LOL)

Brian the old man (2010-11-03 05:02:34)
I have had many a sleepless night and am now blessed that He gives me rest in His love and comfort.

Amanda (2010-11-03 05:02:52)
Wanda, unbelief is a topic we have been discussing at our Church. It really is the root of a lot of issues.
Praying that we would all truly trust Him and rest in full assurance of His Word.
God bless you and happy WFW sis!

GlowinGirl (2010-11-03 05:23:21)
I didn’t get much rest last night as I slept in Baby Girl’s room for awhile, so I feel this! :)
I truly agree though, and I’ve been struggling a bit with anxiety lately. Isn’t it odd, then, that as I do a Bible study
with my son on the day I’m really struggling we discuss one of God’s Names: Jehovah-Shalom? The LORD is Peace.
He gives rest to our rushing minds and racing hearts.

Nicole (2010-11-03 07:04:16)
Love this verse! Thanks so much for sharing it with us. Happy WFW to you!
He is the only way to find that peace, that rest that we so much need!

Joanne Sher (2010-11-03 07:26:56)
Sooooo true. Wonderful stuff, Wanda.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-03 08:35:20)
There’s nothing like the truth but the truth. At all the times when I have failed to rest, it has always been because
I’ve had ”something on my mind” a/k/a worry, anxiety, fears....UNBELIEF. Help, Lord.

cHe (2010-11-03 08:42:39)
love this verse. Great sharing as well, God bless and happy WFW!

Pia (2010-11-03 09:12:00)

Katie (2010-11-03 10:34:31)
You put this in such honest and true words!!! This gives me something to think about!

lori (2010-11-03 10:34:32)
sleep and rest...indeed not always the same! I have to LAUGH...I have my girls decorate pillowcases as an activity in
Bible Study revolving around the theme of ”Rest.” This is PERFECT for this study! I swear! Your words here are so
perfectly timed!
Be blessed Wanda!
peace,

This is spot on. Thanks for sharing. I think I’m going to go crawl in my bed now ;) Thanks also for stopping by my
page. God bless.

Faith Imagined (2010-11-03 11:12:29)
Very good point! When we fret we are not believing that God has complete control over the situation. This is
something I have to remind myself of daily.

Peggy (2010-11-03 13:48:02)
Blessings Wanda... Wonderful WORD! May you find true rest and deep sleep
as you truly trust Him and all anxious and fretting cease! Good follow up to my fret busters last week! Rest in His
beloved arms, Wanda! (I had to laugh at the ”despite sheet thread count, bed type, etc. ...”) Let God handle all
situations, You know He will and tells us to cast it all on Him! But I’m glad you acknowledged this... good lesson for
us all!
Peace and rest in Christ,
Peggy

Toia (2010-11-03 14:17:59)
Amen!! True rest comes from God. We have to be willing and able to give all our cares/burdens to Him. And trust
Him to fix because His ways and thoughts are not like ours. They are better!!!
Blessings to you!!! Happy WFW!!!

Wanda (2010-11-03 14:36:41)
**MCH** I guess we all at some point think we know what’s best.
**PPTAW** Thanks for stopping by today.
**Hip-chick** That’s the perfect place to turn.
**Yvonne,** hope you enjoy a lovely day too!
**Ozjane** thanks for sharing those tips. I’m definitely a proponent of journaling, although though I don’t do every
night. Any remedies for a barking dog ;)
**Amanda** I agree that it’s at the root of a lot of issue and unless it’s undressed and revealed for what it really is we
only address the symptoms. Never getting the real help needed.
**Glowingirl**Oh He knows how to get our attention and give us just what we need. I experienced a time in my life
where I would have night terrors and I constantly had to declare that the Lord was Peace! Hadn’t thought about that
in some time now but your statement brought it to my remembrance.
Amen, **Nicole**
Thanks for stopping by**Joanne**
**Che** Happy WFW to you. Glad to have you stop in.
Thank you, **Joyful**
No better one to call on for help**Bluebutterfly**
**Kim** thanks. Resting in Him takes place when we’re wide awake too.
**Pia**, as believers in Christ we often over look the subtle way that unbelief can creep in.
**Kathie** I pray that if unbelief has crept into your life that the Holy Spirit would reveal it to you. Thanks for stopping
by.
**Lori** lol...that is so ironic isn’t it. I love the idea of decorate pillowcases. You always give me some ideas.
**Denise** blessings to you.
**Dunlizzie** enjoyed visiting you and hope you experience His rest.
**Alisa** so true!
**Peggy** thanks and I truly slept much better last night. Yeah, even the finest linen at the most exotic resort can’t
purchase us His rest and peace.
**Toia** you summed it up perfectly.

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-11-03 16:28:12)
With all of my transition in recent months, I found myself having many restless nights. I would sleep but not actually
sleep. I recall telling a friend that I felt like my mind was constantly going, processing throughout the night. You’re
right. I was trying to deal with things and figure things out that I should have placed on the altar each day. Lately,
I’ve been making a sincere effort to let the word of the Lord be the last thing I take in at night. His word truly gives
me peace, and He blesses me with true rest each night. I pray the same for you, my friend. :-)

Mary (2010-11-03 19:31:16)
Amen! Thanks so much for sharing. Blessings on your day.

Ellen aka Ella (2010-11-03 22:30:26)
Wow Wanda, you always make me pause and reflect I do think our timeline doesn’t always match up!
xXx

lioneagle (2010-11-04 06:00:47)
Hi Wanda -
We all have our moments when we engage in unbelief but thanks be unto GOD who is able to keep us from falling!
Praise His holy name.

Marsha (2010-11-04 09:10:25)
Wanda, what a wise word here. I really hadn’t thought about that. Thanks so much for sharing this.

Lorena G. Sims (2010-11-04 12:16:55)
Amen! That was a wonderful verse. I have been sleeping but not resting lately. There are so much things I want to
do but couldn’t do or don’t know how to do it. I just can’t help myself to not think about or worried about it. I guess
I need to learn to let go and give it all to God and believe that he will take care of me. Thank you Wanda, for letting
God use you to get to me today and to others. God Bless

LisaShaw (2010-11-04 12:59:35)
Wanda, this is powerful and on point!
I’m thankful that when we are made aware of ourselves through His Word then we can be changed in His Word. I
often have to remind myself through the Word of GOD that it is in Him I live and move and have my being and as
such, why do I need to worry about anything?! He not only can handle it, HE will. He’s GOD and He’s my (our)
GOD and He loves His children.
Bless you for sharing a powerful WORD!

Lisa (2010-11-04 18:18:07)
Wonderful thoughts shared! We’ve been studying this in our ladies Bible study too.

Debra Kaye (2010-11-04 22:29:10)
Wanda,
Loving this verse and this beautiful truth!
God bless you!

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2010-11-05 00:45:03)
True rest can elude us until we enter His rest. Your graphic was quite appropriate. The beautiful room still can’t give
us the peace we seek.
Thank you for the reminder.
Blessings,
Janis

Just Be Real (2010-11-05 18:49:40)
Hey Wanda, the Scripture and the message of your post is so timely. Thank you for being open to the leading of the
Spirit. Blessings.

MTJ (2010-11-05 19:24:02)
Hi Wanda,
This topic has been in my thoughts lately. Learning not to be focused on the outcome, or when will it be over, but
just trusting the Lord as I go through this. This is not easy for me. I’m not a patient man, but I’m learning patience
is needed.
You are in my prayers my sister. May the Lord give you grace and peace in abundance that you may experience rest
during your sleep.
Blessings and peace.

Mariel (2010-11-06 10:21:34)
thank you for sharing this..my boys were sick the other night and that along with the roller coaster of emotions of a
hubs who’s been unemployed for nearly a year adds up to many sleepless nights. I do often find myself being reminded
of TRUE REST and my need to soak in it. Just this morning I read Ps46:10...Be still and know who God really is!
There is rest there!!
Thank you for sharing this! It blessed me!! :)

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-07 22:22:40)
True rest -
I’m not sure that there are too many other words that resonate more with me. I tend to be an anxious person, the
family ”worrywart” - and the idea of peaceful rest is just plain...restful, calming, wonderful! A balm to my soul!
Thanks for this good word.
Lord, I believe - help my unbelief.
GOD BLESS!

Just Be Real (2010-11-08 17:05:50)
Hey Wanda came back for some more refilling of my Spirit. Blessings.

Wanda (2010-11-08 19:12:07)
JBR, I’m honored that you’d come back for a second helping. Praying that you’ll find true rest in Him.
Sharon, I find myself praying same thing...Lord I believe but help my unbelief. Sounds a bit contradictary but it’s so
true. Some areas I find so easy to believe Him and others are much more difficult.
Mariel, be still and resting in Him during the hard times of our lives can be difficult but it’s certainly possible because
His word tells us to do so.
MTJ, thanks so much for your prayers. There needed and much appreciated.
Janis, our physical environment has little impact on true rest.
Debra Kaye and Lisa, thanks!
Lisa Shaw-amen!
Lorena, I certainly understand about being in a place of not quite sure but I pray that as you rest in Him you’ll be
able to hear and heed His voice.
Marsha, thanks to you for stopping by.
Sandra, you’re right. He’s able to hold us up.
Ellie, true. Sometimes He moves much slower than I would like ;)
Mary, blessings to you too.
Monica, having the word as your last thing at night sounds like a great practice.
Thanks to all of you for taking a moment to share your thoughts. Hoping you’ll abide in His sweet rest.

Patrina’s Pencil (2010-11-08 21:55:22)
Loved your comment at One Heart’s Place - came to say Hi. This is a good honest post, Wanda. You got it - Scripture
doesn’t lie. It is unbelief, and I struggle with this. I trust Him - I think I really really do -but then I get fearful about
these unknowns in my life, ya know? Maybe I just don’t trust me with knowing His perfect will... it becomes a circle
in my head sometimes.
blessings for a great week

Wanda (2010-11-09 06:01:21)
Hi Patrina, happy to have you stop over for a visit from my bloggy sister’s place. I believe we all struggle with unbelief
at some point in our lives. But He is our helper.

Bernadine (2010-11-09 14:37:46)
So true Wanda. I find that when there is tormoil of any kind in my life the first thing to disappear is my sleep. I’ve
also found though that when I turn it over to Him I’m able to rest knowing that He has it all in control.
Thanks for sharing.

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-07-31 13:51:05)
So true! We need to wait and have more faith. This must be a constant mantra and prayer for ourselves. We must
keep the faith and stop fretting. He will take care of everything! Thank you, for this post.
P.S. In an earlier post, you shared a tattered door and a Scripture. I am creating a few new bookmarks and would
like to send you a copy using the photo and Scripture. Could you send the link to my business: prayernotesbycyn-

## Its No Secret by Rachel Olsen (2010-11-09 06:01)

[1] Right from the cover, Its No Secret: Revealing Divine Truths Every
Woman Should Know by Rachel Olsen gives you a warm and inviting feel. The perfect atmosphere for our
Yahweh sister, Rachel, to share 12 truths she has learned along her journey with the Lord.
In true Titus 2 like form brimming with Southern hospitality, she invites us in to see not just her triumphs
but struggles as well. Using her life stories along with Bible scriptures she tackles issues like: competiveness,
conflict resolution, perfectionism, confession, receptiveness to help from others, humility, and busyness. Each
chapter closes with study questions, which would be great to use as part of a group study or individually.
Being what I call a recovering perfectionist Chapter 7 Adjust Your Scale: Revealing the Secret to Per-

fection in Gods Eyes really resonated with me. Her statement on page 136 points out how, for the most
part, we perfection-seeking types have been trying to measure up based upon performance rather than grace
alone.

```
Weve been conditioned to earn our way, to perform correctly, to not make mistakes. We seek
love and respect from God and others through what we do and how well we do it. In turn, we
expect others to earn our love and respect. To a degree, we even expect God to earn it by blessing
us with the good life so long as we behave well.
```

For those of us who have a hard time asking others for help, Rachel reminds us in the secret of interde-
pendence that we are not just weighing ourselves down needlessly but also robbing our fellow sisters and
brothers.

```
Refusing to ask them deprives them of their opportunity to serve, of their opportunity to
fulfill their purpose.
```

While the book is light-hearted, it is confrontational as well. Cutting away the excuses we often use for
having a deeper and more intimate walk with the Lord.
Thanks to Karen Davis at [2]The B &B Media Group for providing a complimentary copy of the book for
review purposes. Views and opinions expressed are my own.

Our Lord is truly about relationships....

## Do You Want It or Not? (2010-11-10 00:00)

Do you want to get well? John 5:6b (NIV)

[1]

Seems like a rather strange question to ask a sick person. Does it not? But its easy to find comfort even in
a place of sickness and be satisfied to just complain. While most people would readily seek physical wellness,
one can easily overlook the sick ideologies, attitudes, and heart conditions that govern our lives. For we
all can think of some good reason why we have the right to be in that condition. Just as He did for the lame
man at the pool, Jesus offers us the opportunity to lay aside all the reasons why. And He asks do you want
to get well?

Anonymous (2010-11-10 01:25:28)
Blessings Wanda... I’m so thankful for the HEALER making me completely well inside and out and that I am more
than willing to ask Him to help me into the ”pool of healing waters”. I just read this in my Daily Reading plan and I
thought, who would say that they did not want to get well? Yet, you’re right, good point you made! But I also think
some of us, are ignorant or unaware of what needs healing in us.
Praising Jesus that He’s still healing and He’s the GREATEST PHYSICIAN for all we need! That He searches and
knows our hearts and if we desire for all to be well in our souls... not to wallow and complain or use it as a ”crutch”.
Peace in Christ and wellness,
Peggy
amazing Grace... (I’m signed out sorry)

jhunnelle (2010-11-10 01:41:38)
Sad to say, sometimes instead of running to Jesus when we’re sick we run to the hospital. Praise Him for He is our
great healer not only physically and emotionally but most of all spiritually.
Blessings!

ozjane (2010-11-10 02:07:53)
Such a good question as so often we sabotage our own good health.

welcome to my world of poetry (2010-11-10 03:15:49)
A good question, and a good post to read.
Have a nice day.

gemini (2010-11-10 04:51:26)
Yes...the truth about this world is really hurting but God heals our sick souls.

GlowinGirl (2010-11-10 04:58:18)
I love that Jesus asked that question – that He put that thought out there for all of us. Do we truly want it? Do we
want to let go of those things that make us sick?
Something good to ponder, Wanda. Thanks!!

a sojourner (2010-11-10 05:15:49)
Shalom friend:)
Wanda, right up until recently i desired physical healing. living with this disease is very painful and one finds that as
the weeks/months pass by, your personal activities become very limited. it makes living very uncomfortable for you.
but having said that, i realize that being spiritually healed and having a FULL relationship with our heavenly Father
is first and foremost the important thing that matters. as my physical limitations dwindle, my relationship with Him
improves beecause i spend more time with Him. what’s wrong with that. sure, i have days that i don’t always feel
this way. i gotta be real here. will tell you another reason as well. since i’m a sheep thats prone to wander....i worry
that if God did heal me, i might wander off back to the world and forget about Him and what He has/had done. that
could easily happen for me sis. i NEVER want to forget or toss what He has given me already aside....and walk away
from Him.

Amy (2010-11-10 05:45:37)
YES! I want to be well in Him! Cured of my unfaithfulness and doubt! Thank you for this reminder!
Happy WFW!

Good morning Wanda!!!
What a powerful image...we tend to want the ”quick fix” don’t we? Sometimes the Lord’s approach is a little longer
process...soooo good!!! This weekend we heard a message on healing and deliverance...it’s a process of trust...this was
awesome!!
Peace,
Lori

Susan (2010-11-10 08:47:05)
I don’t think there is any more POWERFUL truth then in that question Jesus asked the man.
All of seem to make excuses for our failings and weaknesses in our lives, while Jesus is there WAITING for to make
us WHOLE.
GREAT word.

Pia (2010-11-10 10:24:31)
a specific question that’s waiting for a specific answer.
YES Lord!
how awesome our God is.

Joanne Sher (2010-11-10 11:24:04)
Soooo true, Wanda. It’s easy to ”rest” in our illness - but God wants SO much more for us, if only we ask.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-10 11:39:45)
Jesus asked some pointed questions in the Bible, and this is definitely one of the. We have to have the will to accept
the way to be well. Jesus is certainly willing to make us well. Lord, help us accept your offer of wholeness.

Cathy (2010-11-10 12:20:30)
Isa 53:5 -
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon

Maxine (2010-11-10 18:07:55)

God and seek His healing. Bless you, Wanda. Nice hearing from you today.

Arlee Bird (2010-11-10 20:49:54)
You are so right about this. I think there are some people who wouldn’t know what to do without their ailments.
They like the attention and it gives them something to talk about.
Such a sad way to live ones life.

Arlee, I so agree. It seems like some people try to out do others with complaining.

Wow Wanda, it makes you reflect, I do think it can be a burden and sometimes over lap into a pamper fest. I do want
to get well, but it won’t happen in my lifetime. My disease generates to much $ and jobs.
I hope n’ pray, some diseases will
be cured! xXx

Andrea (2010-11-12 08:03:25)
Sometimes the condition last so long that we forget that nothing is impossible for God. He is able to heal us inside
and out; physically, emotionally and spiritually.

Amydeanne (2010-11-12 20:06:57)
ain’t that the question of all time? LOL. I love it!

MTJ (2010-11-12 22:09:58)
Hi Wanda,
As I read this post, I found myself going back to the scriptures and reading more about the encounter between Jesus
and this man.

```
I asked myself what does this say to me personally? I reflected on your something you said, ”...Jesus offers us the
opportunity to lay aside all the reasons why.”
How often do I offer plausible reasons why?
Is this encounter a metaphor for a spiritual condition?
The man wanted to be healed because he kept returning to the pool and yet He also believed someone would always
be preferred over him. Did he think he was unworthy of healing?
How does my view of myself affect my concept of God?
You’ve (once again) stimulated some questions which I will seek to answer. I’ve begun writing a book and I no longer
have time to read many of the blogs that bless, inspire and encourage me.
I didn’t want to allow the week to escape me without visiting The Watered Soul.
Blessings and peace.

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-12 22:14:04)
Wanda,
I was reminded of this Scripture:
Matthew 9:12-13: ”When Jesus heard this, he said, ’Healthy people don’t need a doctor - sick people do...For I have
come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.”
AMEN?
I’m so glad that He has healed the diseased, sinful spirit within me, and made me whole. I pray for those who still
need to know they’re sick...
GOD BLESS!

```
LisaShaw (2010-11-14 09:42:12)
Oh this is RICH and PRICELESS!! A powerful question not only did the LORD ask of that man but of us, ”Will
thou be made whole?”
Amen and Amen Wanda on this message!
```

```
Wanda (2010-11-14 21:42:07)
Hi Lon, happy to have you stop by for a visit and as I have time, I’ll be sure to visit your blog.
Ellie, interesting point my friend. I do believe there are some conditions that generate big bucks for those who man-
ufacture products to treat the disease but God remains able to heal.
Andrea, so true. It’s in the extended waiting period that our faith is under extreme pressure.
Thanks Amydeanne!
MTJ, now you make want to do another review of the passage. Those question you posed are some I need to meditate
upon myself. Let me know when you finish the book. I’m sure many will be blessed by it.
Sharon, hadn’t thought about that passage but it goes along so well. Even natural doctors require that the patient
recognizes some type of ”sickness” otherwise they don’t offer any treatment. Love it.
LisaShaw, yes He’s asking each of us.

## The Need (2010-11-13 06:13)

Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do Gods will. Then you will receive all
that he has promised.For in just a little while, the Coming One will come and not delay. Hebrews 10:36-37
(NLT)
For a couple of days now Ive been meditating on this scripture. Just taking time to chew on it. It has
actually come up a few times this week in other places like the pastors sermon and even a book Im reading.
Thus I think its something I need to take note. As Ive mentioned in previous post here, patience is not

always a word Im eager to embrace. Then it has the audacity to sit right next door to another one of those
often unwelcome words for me  endurance.
Oh how easy it is to start a new thing but to continue in spite of adversity can be the most challenging
part. When the results do not turn out the way I expected, it does not take a whole lot of words from the
naysayers or even my negative self-talk to convince me to throw in the towel. To simply chalk it up as I
misheard God. But, like a dog hanging onto a bone, this scripture refuses to loose its grip on my mind.
The writer points out that patient endurance is a need now. Not a want. The very situation I long to run
away from and he speaks that I need to endure it but not just any old way. But to endure in patience. Why?
So that I can continue to do Gods will. Only in continuing do I position myself to receive the promise. He
says in just a while expect to see manifestation.
Leaving prematurely doesnt stop the manifestation of the coming one. Only my ability to see it when it
does show up. Its like waiting for a bus and it seems to be late. After waiting for a few moments, I leave
and catch a ride with someone else. Those who had the patience to wait were able to ride. But because I
lack the ability to endure the wait, I missed the bus but it didnt impact the bus arrival.
Dear Lord, I hear you speaking and I pray that you strengthen me as I wait upon you Lord. I dont want to
forfeit your promises that you have for me. I pray for every sister and brother that are torn between waiting
longer or turning away. Father give them clarity on what your will is regarding the matter. If youre calling
them to stand, I pray that you will help them to endure filled with patience as only you can provide. We
choose to take your word as final authority in our lives. In Jesus name, Amen.

and trusting Him to act. [1]My post on endurance

Hi Wanda for all the inspiration and support you give, there is an award on my Christmas Shopping blog.
Yvonne.

MTJ (2010-11-14 01:32:03)
Hi Wanda,
I read this post and my first thought is _Wow!_ Thank you so much my sister.
When you say, ”**...how easy it is to start a new thing but to continue in spite of adversity can be the**
**most challenging part.**” – _I can relate to that._
I believe that God understands my capacity in a way that I never will. More than anything, I believe He desires me
to trust Him, to stay connected with Him; _even when I’m faced with the most challenging adversity in my life._ I’m
learning to see these are opportunities to grow in patience and endurance.
Blessings and peace.

Oh friend, I think we’re twins! I knew I saw a resemblance (smile) for I thought the first paragraph was written by
me (smile).
Oh boy – patience and patient endurance!
Powerful message Wanda and as I pray for you I’m praying for myself as well.
I’ve been chewing on Hebrews 10 lately myself. I bet we could sit down over coffee, tea or water and share a few
thoughts!!
Love and blessings!!

Trudy (2010-11-14 20:30:08)
Oh, dear Wanda...thank you for this post! God led me here to you today and I know why. He is calling me to patient
endurance also, just as my flesh is wanting to ’catch the next bus’. This Scripture will stay with me also.
God’s blessings to you!
Trudy

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-15 02:07:48)
I prayed the prayer you wrote. It’s just what I needed to say to the Lord today. There are many distressing circum-
stances in my life, and the life of my family right now. It’s difficult to know which way to turn. I hear the Lord, I
need His strength, I must learn to endure with patience.
And give me peace...
GOD BLESS!

Wanda (2010-11-15 03:31:23)
Mike that sticking with it can be the hard part for me.
Thanks, Cherie.
Joanne, ”need” stood out to me in this passage of scripture as well. There are many things I want right now but here
I was reminded of what I actually need.
Yvonne, thanks Yvonne ;)
MTJ, you’re learning a very valuable lesson my friend.
Lol...Lisa, great minds think alike ;) I’m sure I’d glean a lot from you.
Trudy, your little one looks so handsome on your profile. While each of us might be walking through different circum-
stances in our lives, I believe God is trying to develop patient endurance in many of us. As you wait on Him, there is
reward. And your final destination is VICTORY.
Sharon, I’m honored that you found that prayer useful my sister. He gives both the will and the ability to wait on

```
Him.
Thanks to each of you for sharing your thoughts. Wishing a blessed week ahead.

Love it...not the patience part but the analogy of the bus. No, but seriously, I love the truth shared about patience
too. It is evidence of the Holy Spirit living in us–His fruit, mature fruit.
Love your header. Thanks for stopping by and thanks for sharing. Have a gorgeous Monday.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-15 15:45:11)
”endurance NOW”. Many don’t realize that as long as they don’t learn to wait, they will miss the blessing that
happens along the way. It is those blessings that prepare us for all that God has in store for us.

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-11-16 00:10:56)
I am just having an opportunity to read this post. I’m glad I took the time to do so. You couldn’t know that I am
contemplating ”giving up” on some things, but the Father knows. He always provides encouragement for us at the
time we need it. Thank you for being a willing vessel.

Wanda (2010-11-16 04:38:06)
Thanks, Lon.
Lol...One Heart,oh, who loves the waiting part any way.
Monica you’re right God knows how to serve up just what we need when it’s needed. Hang in there girl!

Hi Wanda -
How true your words are!
I like your use of ”stand” and ”We choose to take your word as final authority in our lives.” Yes, Amen!
```

```
Dean Spencer (2010-11-17 04:14:39)
Wanda -
I certainly can relate to some of the same challenges you mention. It is way too easy to be impatient and move on. I
think sometimes I do it out of selfishness.
This is a good reminder of the patience and endurance I desperately need from the Lord. Great post! God bless!

## Tuesdays T(s): Teaser & Thanks (2010-11-16 09:00)

THE TEASER

Rather than give you a quote from the latest book Im reading, I wanted to whet your appetite with one
from Yvonne at Spiritual Seed Food for the Souls post entitled, [1]There is a Prepared Place for You.

```
If we are working on jobs or in careers that were not prepared for us (by God), then the
ones to whom it was prepared for are displaced, because we are occupying territory that does not
belong to us! Not only are we out of the will of God, we are forfeiting our prophetic destines and
purposes. Again, if we are occupying territory that God designed for someone else, and we are
in their spots, we are also keeping those people out of their destinies and purposes as well.
```

Using Mark 10:40 as a reference she shares some insights she received regarding operating in ones prepared
place. I encourage you to pop over and read the entire post. As someone still trying to discover her
prepared place I was chasten but encouraged to continue seeking the place.
THE THANKS
On another note I would like to recognize another Yvonne. (I really hadnt plan it that way.) A great big
(((hug))) and thanks to Yvonne at [2]Welcome to My World of Poetry, where she dishes up poems covering
a full range of subjects. She recently pass the wholesome blogger award to me.

[3]
It is rather ironic that wholesome is in the name of the award. Im always talking about watching whole-
some shows. These eyes try to avoid things that would interrupt the sleep. Hope you each have a terrific
Tuesday.

## Ever Asked Why? (2010-11-17 06:03)

[1]

I say this because I know what I am planning for you, says the Lord. I have good plans for you, not plans
to hurt you. I will give you hope and a good future. Jeremiah 29:11 (NCV)
Why does He say hold on, when you feel like quitting?
Why does He say let that go?
Why does He say forgive them?
Why does He speak life when all you can see around you is death?

Why does He say have faith in spite of what you see?

Because He knows the complete plan He has for our lives. The Message version says, I know what I’m doing.
I have it all planned out - plans to take care of you, not abandon you, plans to give you the future you hope
for. Can not tell you how many times I started out thinking I knew exactly what to do or what I wanted.
Only to end up so far away from my plan but I find comfort in knowing that even when Im lost, God is
fully aware of both my current location and my final end.

Stop by the Internet Cafe for others serving up fresh doses of the Word in graphics today. [2]

Now... on to the post. I love this too. What an important truth to remember. We don’t always understand why
He wants us to do certain things, but HE DOES!! Trust, trust, trust in His plan is what we have to do... Someday
it will all make sense.

I’m reading a wonderful, spirit-filled, book called Crazy Love. You should take a look at it. It has me thinking about

Yes, it does, **Ozjane**, when we keep that truth in the forefront our minds.
Thanks**GlowinGirl**! Yes much of it will never make sense on this side of Heaven but we must keep in mind that He’s
using it all as a part of His plan.
**Jhunnelle>**It’s one of my favorites too.
**Sherry**, His super exceeds our own. It’s just hard at times to get that wrapped around our mortal minds.
**Yvonne** , i think we all do wonder why.
**Ellie**thanks. Not lost to Him anyway.
**Joan** thanks for the scripture reference you added. We’re taking steps along His predestined plan.
**Rae** honored you’d take time to peep in today. I’m a book lover and I’ve heard a lot of good things about the book.
I’ll have to add it to my TBR list. Thanks for the recommendation. Continue to soak up His presence.

Peggy (mazmagi) (2010-11-17 16:51:28)
AMEN and many blessings FALL on you Wanda... cuz I love your new fall look...simple beautiful!
And as per the ”plan” He has for us;
I love your message, The Message and that He holds the plan - completely in His hands.
Trust that when I can’t see the final draft, or can’t quite wrap my head around the ”whys” that Our Lord God
Almighty knows what He’s doing and wants the BEST for me, will keep me from harm (is what I recall from the
version I know of this verse)
yet there have been days I too have wondered about this and ”started out thinking I knew...” like you,
God had a different plan for my future, so YES, I will TRUST the Plan Maker... the Divine Master Planner, who
holds it all in detail. So thankful we can rest in that trust and HOPE for our future.

Peace in His plan,
Peggy

Love and blessings and thank you for sharing!

One Heart (2010-11-18 15:47:35)
Beautiful reminder as usual. Just yesterday while driving down the highway in prayer, I said to the Lord that I would
not ask why but simply ask for a glimpse of one of His particular promises in the natural. No, that’s not always
guaranteed, but His promises are most definitely assured. It’s enough to know that in Him alone all of our why’s are
put to rest. Not always easy because these limited minds get in the way, but His grace is more than sufficient. Thanks
for sharing, Wanda.

Faith Imagined (2010-11-18 19:02:05)

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-19 03:45:16)
So, so true, Wanda!
He makes me move when I want to stay. He makes me wait when I want to go.
Why, Lord - the question I’ve asked since I was young. ”Because I KNOW...” He says.
Weave my tapestry, Lord - use the threads that you desire. Complete the picture of my faith...lead me.
Thanks for this inspiring and encouraging word.
GOD BLESS!

Just Be Real (2010-11-19 11:14:50)
I believe ”why” is a popular word in the Christian vocabulary. Great post Wanda. Blessings. He is in control indeed.

## Any time is a good time (2010-11-19 12:33)

In my distress, I prayed to the Lord,
and the Lord answered me and
set me free. Psalms 118:5
Thank you Lord that I dont have to wait till Im in the perfect frame of mind. But youre available to
commune with at any time despite my condition.
In frustration I can come.
In joy I can come.
In despair I can come.
In pain I can come.
In sickness I can come.
In love I can come.
In hopelessness I can come.
In sorrow I can come.
You dont ignore me. You are not too busy. Even with all the others calling upon your name, you have time
to hear my cry. You dont leave me like I came but you set my mind free. You make an exchange with me
so that I come out better, lighter, freer. Who but you Oh Lord, can set my soul free? Who can break the
chains of oppression? There is none but you Lord!

## In Need of a Boost (2010-11-22 14:26)

There are those days when you just feel a bit down or grieved but theres a pick-me-up available for us.
Psalms 119: 25,28 reminds me of this truth.

I lie in the dust;

revive me by your word.

I weep with sorrow;

encourage me by your word.

Its at those times that I need to feed upon His Word. May the Lord open our eyes to see the wonderful truths
in His Word. As we turn to Him and consume His Word may we be revived and encouraged to continue on
the journey.

Hi Wanda,
This weekend I read several blogs which referenced 1 Thessalonians 5:18, ”**give thanks in all circumstances**”.
Yesterday during worship service, I began confessing my thanks to God. I realized that **in my current circum-**
**stance**, I could thank the Sovereign Lord for His grace that enables me to endure my circumstance.
This passage in Psalm 119, also speaks to me of God’s unchanging love and grace given to those who call on Him.
Hebrews 12:28-29 says, ”**Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be**
**thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, for our ’God is a consuming fire.’**”
May week seek to be consumed by The Eternal God.
Blessings and peace.

## The Real ID (2010-11-24 05:02)

[1]

1 Peter 2:10 Once you had no identity as a people; now you are Gods people. Once you received no mercy;
now you have received Gods mercy. (NLT)

Ask the question, who are you, and you are likely to hear a myriad of responses ranging from a persons
family role to their job title. Yet those pale in comparison to being identified as one of Gods people. I like
The Message version of that verse which says, from nothing to something, from rejected to accepted.

Drop by [2]Internet CafÈ Devotions for more Word-Filled Wednesday.

Wishing you and yours a Happy Thanksgiving

**A Million Ways to Die: The Only Way to Live (2010-11-27 21:23)**

[1]

Rick James latest book A Million Ways to Die: The Only Way to Live is one those books that grabbed
my attention with its striking cover image. While the cover may be intriguing, the subject of death is often
one we would rather avoid. Throughout this book James encourages the believer to look beyond the final
death and resurrection and to embrace the daily opportunities to die. Each of us faces opportunities to die
to selfish ambition, ego, pride, fear, reputation, and self-sufficiency.

By examining scripture, historical events, and personal life stories, he points out practical ways in which
we can fulfill Jesus command to take up our cross. He points out that only through embracing these little
deaths can the believer move from a mere mediocre existence to the vibrant, victorious life Christ came to
give us.

The book contains 335 pages that are filled with statements that will cause one to pause and think. Here
are a few of those that made me go hmmm.

```
Its reflexive for us to declare our belief that God can, but such affirmations can blind us to
the ways that we dont believe. I believe that God can is sometimes just a contraction for I
believe that He can, but I doubt that He will.
```

```
We mistake divine ordained hardships for bad luck, bad friends, a bad year, bad breaks, bad
government, a bad choice, bad advice, bad genes, bad hair day, and quite naturally we run. A
scalpel is just a knife with a medical motive, and if you hold it to my throat in any scenario other
than during a operation, Id be insane not to run.
```

```
People dont fall out of love; they fail to persevere in loving. They choose to stop loving their
spouse, or they choose to start loving something else.
```

According to the author the goal of the book is to encourage us to pick up our cross and embrace the death
implicit in following Jesus Christ. After reading the book, I had a clearer understanding of the ways life is
produce through dying to myself.
From the back cover
Death is the new life. As Christians we talk often about resurrection, but what about our death and the
many daily deaths that must come first? Through stories and biblical insights, Rick James reminds us
that when Jesus tells us to deny ourselves, take up our crosses, and follow Him, He is describing a path of
death, not a path to death.

As we learn to embrace the little deaths of everyday existence, we lose our taste for lifeless religiosity. Our
appetite for a thriving, vibrant life in Christ grows-and our own experience motivates others to live out their
extraordinary missions on earth. As James so vividly illustrates, death is not an ending-invitation to more
abundant life.

DISCLOSURE: I was provided a complimentary copy of the book by B & B Media Group for review purposes.
The views and opinions expressed are my own.

MTJ (2010-11-27 22:33:20)
Hi Wanda,
When I saw the name, Rick James, my thoughts ran to the singer and song writer with racy lyrics. I then thought,
perhaps there is another Rick James who has no affiliation to racy lyrics.
Having exposed myself as one familiar with the other Rick James, I see that the author of A Million Ways to Die
discusses the practical need for the Christian to ”...embrace the daily opportunities to die.”
Living for Christ by dying to self ought to be the goal of any who trust in the salvation of Jesus Christ.
Thanks for sharing this book review and for waking me up from my momentary lapse into the past.
Blessings and peace.

opportunity to die.

Sounds awesome. I remember a Pastor one day coming up to the pulpit and simplying saying.
”Did you know God wants to kill you”?
He then went on to explain this profound bibical concept backed by the word. Decades later I still recall that intro.
This sounds like a good book to build up any of those details I may have forgotten. Thanks for the review.
```

```
Wanda (2010-11-29 04:54:50)
Hi Analisa I’d definitely recommend the book for anyone looking for ways to enhance their spiritual life. Your pastor
had a great opener to his message and I’m sure that questioned would have lingered with me as well.
```

```
Ellen aka Ella (2010-11-29 05:16:06)
Wow, sounds like an amazing book, to pick up where we have let off or lack hope and re invent or change our view!
Sounds like a great way to recommit to those people, projects, things we have let slide
Hope you had a Wonderful Thanksgiving

**Goodbye White Pages (2010-11-29 09:00)**

[1] According to a newspaper article I read recently, phone books are
becoming a thing of the past. With more people embracing technology and many doing away with landline
phones, telephone service providers see a decline in the need for a printed book. Not to mention it helps cut
their costs and helps saves the trees. Reportedly three states-New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania- have
adopted regulations allowing providers to cease printing. Photo credit: [2]19melissa68 via Flickr

Depending upon the area you live those phone books can be massive. Living in rural area, I do not have
that problem. But, I do have several phone directories in my house and from time to time I do use them but
Im more likely to look a number up online at whitepages.com. But does the use of technology make the old
standby obsolete?

Reading the article caused me to think about another book that many people have at least one copy in their
home  the Bible. Do we consider the words crafted along its white pages as being something that has very
little value in our fast-paced, technology driven lives? Has it become antiquated? Im all for technology but
has it helped us to become more aloof to His Word? Or, has it deepen our longing for His truths? More
sermons, articles, and devotionals are available now more than ever before through podcasts, webcasts, blogs,
and websites. But on a personal level has it lead to you only consuming regurgitated messages from someone
else? Or, has it invoked within you an insatiable appetite for more of Him?

When I asked my younger co-workers for a phone book, they stared at me like I had asked for a horse and buggy.
”Google it!” they said. I pray that the internet will be a valuable tool for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.

```
Joanne Sher (2010-11-29 15:07:23)
We WERE on the same wavelength! So I guess my post could be a comment to yours (hehe).
And maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I can’t imagine not having a paper phone book. Hope Michigan doesn’t go the
way of the other states!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-29 17:42:07)

What a fabulous post. I was already to leave a comment about phone books when I read the end of your post. What
you’ve pointed out is very interested. I wonder if technology has replaced individuals picking up the Bible and reading
it instead of getting it off of blogs and whatnot. I, for other ”reasons,” have not opened my Bible for quite a long time.
Great, thought-provoking post. Thanks.

Peggy (mazmagi) (2010-11-29 21:17:16)
Blessings Wanda,
I’m all for saving a tree but I pray that we do not replace the Tree of Calvary with all this technology, nor the Word
```

He came to BE!
I happen to love the internet but truly do not want to give up having ”books” available whether it’s a phone book or
the GOOD BOOK of GOD!
I have Kindle for PC out of necessity to be able to read some books that are current but there’s nothing like holding
a book in your hands rather than staring at a screen, getting a headache or eye strain. Talking to a person is better
than typing to one. So there’s goods and bads but I could not live without ALL GOOD that comes from having God’s
Word in my hands and in my home.
Great topic and also I enjoyed your other posts but finding it’s time for me to rest my eyes! Thanks for your visit to
Beth Moore’s Mondays.
Peace,
Peggy

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-11-29 22:39:57)
Excellent post, Wanda! I do think with all of our technological advancements, we sometimes treat God’s word as just
another app for our phone or ipad. You know me. I love God’s word, and flipping the white pages of the bible will
never become obsolete.

Sharon Kirby (2010-11-30 02:31:02)
Such a very thought-provoking post, Wanda. I can honestly say that I have never loved my Bible more. Blogging,
devotionals, etc. only increase my desire for God’s Word - the Word that should inspire all thoughts, all sermons,
all messages that come out of a person’s mouth. The Word of God is ALIVE, relevant, penetrating, convicting,
encouraging, inspiring, comforting - the list could go on and on.
I am HUNGRY, Lord - feed me...
GOD BLESS!

Stuff could always be worse (2010-11-30 03:25:08)
Yes I heard that, white pages are gone! Thankful for the best white pages of the Bible

Wanda (2010-11-30 04:13:18)
Thanks Yvonne, I’m always glad to have you stop in.
Karen, that’s too funny. I believe the Internet is a great tool for spreading the good news.
Joanne, we definitely on the same page today ;)
Bluebutterfly & Kim, I’m find myself clinging onto the white pages of the Bible more and more these days.
Ginger, I probably could make it without the phone book, too but they Word I’m hanging onto.
Peggy, as much as I love technology, I still prefer holding a book in my hand too.
Monica, I think we have to be careful so that it doesn’t become just another app for us.
Thanks Petula and I pray that whatever your ”other” reasons are for not picking up the Bible that you’ll be drawn to
the One the Bible speaks of.
Sharon, I definitely finding myself to be more in love with His Word than I’ve ever been. And I get lots of food for
thought when I visit others.
Thanks ladies for chiming in. Hope you each of a blessed week.

lioneagle (2010-12-02 16:37:50)
Hi Wanda -
NOTHING replaces turning the pages of GOD’s Holy Bible.
We have more but many do less than those that did NOT have nearly as much as we do in way of gadgets, technol-
ogy,etc. In the Bible, Enoch had none of that but it says that he walked with GOD and was translated.
There are people who have the latest technology but limited relationships with GOD. May He help us all.

**Dinner for One (2010-11-30 08:00)**

Todays post picks up from the previous post entitled, [1]Goodbye White Pages.

I love reading inspirational posts, books, and devotionals but I cannot allow that to be my main source of
nourishment. God is baking a fresh supply of His Word for us daily but we have to decide to take a seat
at the table and when seated, eat. Jeremiah states he ate Gods word and it was sweet like honey. By all
means, I have had periods of eating His Word and finding it bland. I could not make any sense of it and was
unable to see how it applied to my life. If youre in one of those periods, its important to not get up from
the table. Even in those moments you are receiving vital nutrients.

In order to know God for myself, I have to step away from the leftovers others are serving and get alone and
read His Word myself. Allowing the Holy Spirit to season my spirit man so that the Word becomes palatable
to my daily life. Nothing wrong with leftovers but when we are getting second hand inspiration or revelation
from others you only get the portion they are willing to share. Its impossible to get all they receive. I know
that I have a hard time remembering exactly how the Spirit uncovered a thing to me. So when Im absent
from this place and hadnt stop in at yours, its not because I didnt like what you were serving but I needed
extra time with the master chef Himself.

Have you been taking the time to receive nourishment from the Master Chef or have you been eating the
crumbs from His servants?

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-11-30 19:20:35)
Wanda, there is so much truth here. There is nothing like one-on-one. I talked to a friend I had not seen in ages last
night and at the end of the conversation we planned to meet in person. We realized that though we had kept up with
each other through other friends, it was not the same as being in each other’s presence. I believe it is the same with
God. To be in His presence and to be touched and fed by Him...there is just no other substitute.

MTJ (2010-12-01 02:37:13)
Hi Wanda,
I like the analogy of God’s word as a meal. David proclaims, ”**O God, You are my God; I shall seek You**
**earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is**
**no water.**” (_Psalm 63:1, NIV_)
We followers of Christ are on a pilgramage in which direction, instruction and nourishment are essential; _God’s word_
_supplies us with these provisions._
Blessings and peace.

His Word has been a great source of strength for me this year. I love it like never before. And I can honestly say it
hasn’t always been something I’ve enjoyed; but it can be if you want it to be, for sure. What a beautiful post Sis. I
really enjoyed it. :)

Sharon Kirby (2010-12-01 04:37:26)
Loved this word picture, Wanda.
We NEED the nourishment of the Word. Sometimes it fulfills our need for a snack, or dessert - but we really must
take the time to feast on its banquet - relishing and enjoying every course!
I’m receiving nourishment directly from the Master Chef - but I’m also sitting at the table with some of the servants,
too -
Thanks for your good word - as always, ”FOOD FOR THOUGHT!”
(I just couldn’t resist :)
GOD BLESS!

There seems to be a common thread that I’ve gotten from a couple posts including mine lately where bloggers are
seeing the need to take some time to get back to main course. Very interesting and I totally understand.
In order for us to be effective channels or palors of God’s cuisine, we have to consult with him daily about the menu.

Convicted! Yup, I haven’t been taking time with the Lover of my soul alone lately. I do desire to be like the spring in
the verse from Isaiah. Thank you for reminding me. Love the word picture of God as the Master Chef-meal planning
has been a big occupation of mine since I began Weight Watchers last month. Need to receive some meat from His
Word, prepared just for me. Thanks for stopping by my blog. blessings, k

Hi Wanda -
I returned to blogging Sunday November 28, 2010 after about a three day absence. My first post after my return was,
”I REPENT” dated November 28, 2010. That post expressed on the same wavelength as you have expressed here. I
had allowed myself to depend on other than GOD...the Lord rebuked me and in His mercy and forgiveness, led me
back on course.
I love how you illustrated here those very important points. Yes, there is no substitute for the daily diet of nutrition
straight from GOD, our SOURCE. All else is a resource.
Thank you, Wanda, for the meal!

Carole in the UK (2010-12-05 05:45:44)
Wanda, Amen, what a simply divine way of reminding us that God should be our main source of nourishment. I am
going to link back to this poast, I absolutely love it.
As an avid reader of Inspirational Books and devotions, I had a perfect excuse of carrying out research and reviews
for the Christian Bookshop, I own. However, earlier this year I realised that I was spending more time in my books
and devotionals and watching TV ministries, than I was actually spending time reading Gods Word and getting it
first hand.
As my home library is crammed full of many books on every aspect of the Christian journey, sometimes when needing
a solution to a problem, I always knew which author and which book; I could turn to for suggestions and answers.
I am sorry to admit, that I did not always turn to the author of the Bible first!
Praise God, with the help of the Holy Spirit, Gods Word is now first and final authority in my life and I am continually
feasting on the Bread of Life! The leftovers that you mention in your post, I know see as side salads.
God Bless you Wanda, you have made my day, its wonderful to know that as children of God, we are looking out for
each other.

**Eyes on Him (2010-12-01 03:09)**

[1]

My eyes strain to see your rescue,
to see the truth of your promise fulfilled.
Psalms 119:123 (NLT)
Despite what things may look like all around you, be determined to keep your eyes upon the Savior. Let
looking unto Him be your aim. For those that hope in Him will not be disappointed.

Beautifully said and pictured!

Thanks for dropping by! Happy Wednesday :)

ozjane (2010-12-01 06:41:11)
Well done Wanda....I love it when the word fits the graphic so skillfully.
We have been having Daniel at church also. The Sunday we started I had been away since May on Doc’s orders...stay
home and inside..and the Minister said, there are a lot of people here today who have not been for ages...I wonder
what Daniel is going to say to them. I had just finished reading it myself. he assured me I was one of many or he
would not have picked on me....LOL.
I think I have got back once since and with God’s enormous help I am on the worship team singing this week. 7 am
wake up 8 am rehearsal 9 am service 10.45 service..you are wrecked even when well. But it is try or pull out altogether
and I do not really want to do that.

lori (2010-12-01 07:09:19)

This is WONDERFUL...what a powerful verse and what an awesome graphic...if our eyes are fixed on Jesus and we

God Bless you. It’s always good to hear from you.

GlowinGirl (2010-12-01 14:30:41)
Wanda, I love this!! I love the image you’ve paired with the verse, and I love this translation. Sometimes it takes a
conscious effort to see what God is doing... our eyes must be open and really looking. But He is working!

Pat (2010-12-01 15:08:40)
Hi Wanda
How very true and As I kept my eyes on him while in Charleston for my test of course he showed out!!! ”Hallelujah”!!!
All of the paper work was ready,they double checked everything and the doctor that spoke with me before my test said
can I pray for you,whoa!!! that blew me away again.All of the results were goood ”No Cancer” none Praise God,just
scar tissue and acid reflux,plus I got my new medicine it was $349.15 and I only payed $1.10!! God is taking very
good care of me and I am so grateful,plus Hebrews 12:2 my favorite scripture speaks of us keeping our eyes on Jesus.
O yea wonderful post Wanda.
Love ya

Peggy (mazmagi) (2010-12-01 15:31:35)
Blessings Wanda...
I focused and focused, straining to...
figure out the words backwards below until I just finally had to read the NLT verse you shared completely. There was
something about that eye that drew me to the challenge.
My HOPE is to look to Him, and try to keep my focus always on Him... despite what my life looks like around me...
despite the circumstances... despite the distractions... despite the weight... I will choose to keep my eyes seeking His
rescue, which is all my HOPE and I cling to His promises!
What a great Psalm and depiction for me to focus on...even when or as my eyes are straining, even when I close my
eyes... He is My Rescue, My Deliverer, My Savior, My Hope and Truth! Thank you Wanda for giving me a better
focus!
God’s peace and aMazing grace,
Peggy

**Because of Who You Are (2010-12-03 14:06)**

Oh precious Father, how I love so. Thank you Lord that you dont deal with me as my sins deserve. Forgive
me for all the times I have failed you, doubted you, or grumbled against the course of my life. For you have
been far better to me than I ever could deserve. For you are mighty and sit upon the throne of glory forever.
Who am I that you are mindful of me?

So many things to be thankful for but today I pause to say thank you for sending your son-Jesus-my risen
Savior. And because the Savior rose,

• I and any other, who trust in his name can rise above those things that attempts to hold us captive.
• Because He got up we can rise up from the need to please self and others.
• We can rise above our desires and instead seek your perfect will for our lives. Because He rose, we
can rise past old hurts and troubled past. We can walk in the wholeness He provided for us when He
received those 39 strikes and the blood came running down.

Because His blood came down, we can walk freely. Thank you for the blood that covers minds today. Lord,
silence every voice that speaks contrary to your word. Give us ears to hear you Father and may we not follow
after strange shepherds. Give us the discerning mind you promised us in your word. Illuminate our paths
today precious Father. For we do not know the right path or the correct course of action but you Lord, the
creator of the heavens and earth, knows all things so we turn to you and are attentive to your word.
I pray for the body of Christ all over the world. Strengthen those who are suffering persecution for your
name sake. May the good news of the gospel be boldly proclaimed across every nation and continent. May
the kingdoms of this earth become the kingdom of our great Jehovah God. Let hope spring forth now. Let
joy bubble up within us now as we reflect upon your great name-Jesus.
I thank you for those you are drawing by your Spirit. Thank you for breaking them free. Free from sin, free
from addictions, free from shame, free from bondages. Thank you that it is for freedom that you have set
them free. Free to walk according to your call. Free to be who you destined them to be before the earth was

formed. Thank you for purpose and choosing me to be one of your dearly loved children. You are everything
I need Lord. Love you. In Jesus name, Amen.

Wanda

**Do It Again (2010-12-07 12:00)**

1 It seemed like a dream, too good to be true, when God returned Zion’s exiles. 2 We laughed, we sang, we
couldn’t believe our good fortune. We were the talk of the nations - ”God was wonderful to them!” 3 God was
wonderful to us; we are one happy people. 4 And now, God, do it again - bring rains to our drought-stricken
lives 5 So those who planted their crops in despair will shout hurrahs at the harvest, 6 So those who went
off with heavy hearts will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing. Psalms 126: 1-6 (The Message)
Have you ever had God do something so beyond your natural logic that it seemed like a dream? He moved
you from a place of confinement or captivity into a place of a laughter, singing, and celebration.
But what do you do when you find yourself in another dry, forlorn place? Do you settle in at that place
believing all hope has been lost? In those drought stricken, see nothing of God days, there has been times
that I walked around in the normal day to day activities of life in despair. I went about the business of living
with a heavy heart beneath the shrouds of consistency. Yep I showed up for work, attended church services,
and maintained family responsibilities. Everything the same on the outside but inside bearing weighted
sorrow.
What is it that brings one out of the dark abyss of hopelessness? Could it be the act of remembering? As
I reflect on this scripture this morning, the value in remembering stands out to me. The psalmist takes a
moment to reflect back on a former time when God had shown up and turned their situation around. Now
having a fresh mental image of Gods goodness and faithfulness in times past, he has the courage to believe
and ask God to do a repeat performance. In essence he requests an encore from God.
Are you prepared for encore performance? Do you believe He is able to do it again? No, the situation you
are faced with now does not have to look the same as the previous one. The fact remains that He did show
up and bring an end to some things. He brought changes and even when the situation didnt change, He
changed you.

Wanda

Hey dear sister,
```

I have missed visiting with you over the two weeks I was off line. I prayed for you!!
I am blessed in this message today. You asked: Are you prepared for encore performance? Do you believe He is able
to do it again?
I answer: YES, yes, yes, Do it again LORD!!!
Do you know Pastor Shirley Ceaser? She sang a song He’ll Do it Again. I have it on my blog. I love that song because
it encourages you to focus on the LORD and the fact that what HE’s done before HE’ll do it again. He’ll never fail
us.
I am praying for you friend. Love you.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-12-07 16:33:28)
This resonates so much. God has a way of working .... we can’t imagine big enough...dream big enough...or think
majestic enough for what He has prepared for us.

Yes Amen!!! I’m ready for an encore!!! Because of the things God has already brought me through I know he is able
to do above and beyond what I think or ask.Yes Wanda I’m ready for an ”Encore” now,praise God and it’s coming
God has remiminded me over & over all that I’ve promised you I’m going to do ”Hallelujah” God is Great and Good!!!
Wonderful post Wanda and have a fantastiv evening.

Sharon Kirby (2010-12-08 01:04:25)
So, so good.
I am convinced that looking back and remembering is CRUCIAL in our walk of faith. As we approach the end of
another year, I cannot believe the many things that God has done for me and my family. He is a God of amazing
wonders.
He has brought me this far - He will lead me home.
Encore - yes, indeed!!
In the middle of waiting, He is changing me.

**A Distorted View (2010-12-12 18:54)**

Todays message dealt with a passage from Mark 22-25 about a blind man who was taken to Jesus to be
healed. The speaker pointed out that the first thing Jesus choose to do was to take the blind man out of the
town. No doubt the town was a place of familiarity to him. In their own environment, most blind people can
successfully maneuver around because theyve learned where everything is located. Next Jesus does another
rather strange thing, He spits on the mans eye and lays His hand on him and asks a questions. Can you
see anything? What the man reported he seen was not accurate so Jesus touched his eyes again. With the
second touch came clear vision.
As I reflect back on todays lesson, I cant help but ponder and look through the file cabinet of mind and
ask God what areas in my life have I been seeing men as trees. Men arent trees and trees dont walk. So if

what I see is distorted, my reactions to the situation, person, event will be inaccurate and inappropriate.
Father take me beyond the place of familiarity and comfort. Touch my eyes again that I may see things
clearly. I dont want to operate from a false view of myself or others. Help me to see things as they really
are and not through tinted glasses stained by old hurts, wounds, and bad experiences. Yes, Lord I do see
something but what I see doesnt line up with your Words says so touch my eyes again. Only you can restore
sight.

MTJ (2010-12-12 22:03:07)
Hi Wanda,
Thanks for sharing these insightful words. I have been asking myself questions as I confess my desire to approach and
worship our Lord.
I believe that as I seek spiritual intimacy, I examine myself more closely. I say, ”I examine myself...”, but the truth
is that God reveals to me, my true thoughts and motives. Having eyes, yet lacking the ability to see with clarity. How
often those words have described my attitudes, and behavior. There is a thirst within me now to walk by faith. It is
for me now a struggle within myself; putting to death the life I once lived for myself, taking up my cross and following
Christ.
Lord God, give us the clarity of sight and purpose that we may walk in faith and obedience, pouring out our lives as
an offering of thanks.
Blessings and peace.

Wonderful post! We have to alter our vision and give ourselves a way to adjust our view. Time helps, so does
constantly remaining social, no matter where you are. I can’t imagine you not being, but sometimes we have to push
our boundaries, to see new maps, I mean men. It is a journey. You might have had a few detours, but your path will
continue

So very true, Wanda. The Lord does want us to have clear vision - and sadly, there are SO many things that can
cloud our spiritual eyesight. God alone can examine our hearts, and He alone can reveal the areas where we are blind
or short-sighted.
May He help ALL of us see ourselves, our world, and other people more clearly - may He help us see these things as
HE does.
GOD BLESS!
```

Wanda (2010-12-13 21:07:51)
Thanks to each of you for sharing your thoughts. Hearing from you always blesses me.

**It****s Your Call (2010-12-14 09:30)**

Ever wondered why you are here? What exactly is your purpose in the grand scheme of life? Those are
questions I have pondered more than once or twice during the years. In fact, there was a period in my 20s
that I was on an all out quest to discover my God given purpose. The issue of purpose and calling has been
of great interest to me so when the opportunity came to read Gary Barkalows latest book entitled Its Your

Call, I quickly seized the chance. [1]

And, I was not disappointed. By far Its Your Call is one of the best books I have read regarding calling.
It is not your typical how to manual filled with questionnaires and gift analysis tests. Through personal
reflections of his life and scripture application, he encourages the reader to move past the confines of tests,
job titles, and positions to discover and develop their weightiness. This discovery and development can only
take place through paying attention to our lives and intimacy with the Father. He points out that each
individual has a glory, splendor, beauty, abundance, brilliance, or weightiness that the world is waiting to
experience.

One of the highlights of the book for me was how Gary explained there are four primary ways that the enemy
prevents us from operating in our glory. The 4-d strategies include:

• Distance-uses old wounds to push us away from the desires written upon our heart.
• Diminish-causes one to underestimate the value of their weightiness often through comparisons.
• Disdain-leads one to hate the way they use their gifting
• Disqualification-makes one feel unworthy of walking in their calling because of sin or shortcomings.

The book provides a fresh perspective on an age old topic. I would recommend this book to anyone who has
taken all the assessment tests but are still searching for purpose.

Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary copy of the book by [2]The B &B Media Group for review
purposes. Views and opinions expressed are my own.

**There****s Room Here (2010-12-15 01:30)**

[1]

The Christmas season is a time filled with many things.

Tables spread with decadent treats.

Christmas trees brimming with presents.

Calendars full of activities.

Homes filled with family and friends.

Radio stations filled with Christmas tunes.

Stores full of shoppers looking for the perfect item.

Lists full of things to do.

With so much activity it can be easy to allow our lives to become so full that we squeeze out the very reason
for the season.

12 Make sure that when you eat and are satisfied, build pleasant houses and settle in, 13 see your herds
and flocks flourish and more and more money come in, watch your standard of living going up and up -
14make sure you don’t become so full of yourself and your things that you forget God, your God, the God
who delivered you from Egyptian slavery; Deuteronomy 8:12-14 (The Message)

May We Never Forget Him!

Wanda

It’s so easy to lose sight of the true meaning for our celebration at this time of the year. I spent Sunday morning
listening to a room full of 6th grade girls talk about the real meaning of Christmas. It was amazing how those ”babies”
were able to put everything in right perspective. May we truly never forget Him. Thank you for the reminder, Wanda!

Wanda - A wonderful, timely reminder. I posted a poem today on my blog - along the same lines! (God speaks to so
many of us at the same time, doesn’t
He?!)
We must never forget God - never, ever - because He never forgets us - never, ever!
GOD BLESS

**My Goodie Box (2010-12-18 18:18)**

Recently, I won a giveaway from one my blogger friends Ella of [1]Ellas Edge. Today I received the package
and I was delightfully surprise. Ella had all sorts of goodies tucked away in the box and the absolute cherry
on top was the sweet note she included in the package. I was blessed enough to meet her virtually through
Arlees A-Z challenge in April. Every since shes been just a sweet dose of encouragement to me.
Shes a very crafty and talented lady, who has her own etsy shop. Ella made the two pouches shown. And
here is a peek of the goodies I received.

[2]
Thanks so much Ella; wish you could have seen the smile on my face as I discovered each gift. Im looking
forward to seeing the bulbs bloom.

Dont forget to sign up for my [4]Christmas giveaway. Deadline Sunday, Dec 19th.

**Favor Has Its Own Cost (2010-12-21 13:25)**

Like many this time of year, I have been reflecting upon the story of Jesus birth. On Mary in particular.
From Biblical accounts there was nothing special about this young girl in particular. Yet God singled her
out for the greatest assignmentto birth the Savior of the world. On an ordinary day to an ordinary virgin
girl, an extraordinary visitor arrived an interrupted the ordinariness of her life. Luke 1: 28 states the angel
had the following greeting for Mary,

```
Hail thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
```

Bakers Evangelical Dictionary defines favor as gaining approval, acceptance, or special benefits or blessings.
I like Merriam-Websters definition as well, defines favor as friendly regard shown toward another especially
by a superior. Some how this ordinary virgin girl had gained approval, acceptance or friendly regard by her
ultimate superior, God. I am amazed at her response to such favor. With only one spoken question, she
faithfully accepts the will of God.

To be favored for such an assignment sounds fascinating but I wonder did Mary fully understand the magni-
tude of her yes to favor. The favor that she didnt even ask for positioned her for threats. The favor of God
threatened her:

• Relationships: Because of what she was carrying, Joseph was preparing to walk away from their
engagement.
• Reputation: The Bible does not go into detail but I can just imagine that the towns people had plenty
to say about this young unmarried girl becoming pregnant. Cant you just hear their whispers and see
those funny glances? If Joseph doubted Marys purity how much more would the neighbors.
• Plans: Before the favor showed up, she and Joseph already had things set in motion for their future
marriage. But the impending birth threaten to bring her planned future to a halt.

As I meditate upon these three areas, I am reminded that Mary was not the only to face such assaults.
Joseph had the favor of God but it lead to strained relationship with his own family members. So much so
that they sold him into slavery. Of course, the favor followed him there as well. His run-in with Potiphars
wife threatened his reputation. And I can just imagine that as he sat in the pit and the prison that his vision
of his life looked as if it would never come into fruition.

To be favored is a blessing but it is not void of cost.

```
Joanne Sher (2010-12-21 15:06:08)
What a great reminder - and I LOVE your new header! SUPER last line.
```

```
Sarah (2010-12-21 16:11:08)
We watched ”The Nativity” last night and the same message ran across my heart. What a joy to be favored. What a
privilege and a walk that must be rooted in faith.
Have a joy filled, love overflow Christmas,
Sarah
```

```
welcome to my world of poetry (2010-12-21 19:55:10)

```

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-12-21 20:36:10)
Ah, yes, so many times we forget about the cost in our zeal for the glory and honor of being favored. One does not
come without the other.

Jessica (2010-12-21 20:42:12)
Wanda,
BEAUTIFUL post (as well as a beautiful new layout for your blog). I love pondering the story of Mary and all that
she did as well as Joseph and everyone involved in the birth of Jesus. SO much goes on, and sometimes I know I miss
even the smallest of things. It’s wonderful, as this season is, because of what it did to our lives for eternity.
Many blessings Sister in Christ.

Sharon Kirby (2010-12-21 20:53:38)
Such true words, Wanda.
I really liked how you talked about the three areas where our obedience to God can really affect us - relationships,
reputation, plans. One of my favorite poems is ”Journey of the Magi” by T.S. Eliot. It speaks of the magi finding
Jesus - and then they return to their own lands. It speaks how this ”birth” caused ”death” in their lives - because
nothing could ever be the same again. It’a a thrilling prospect to be changed by the King, and a little unsettling, too.
The cost of discipleship is heavy - it requires death to self - but oh! The rewards of following...
I am reminded of Joseph’s final evaluation of how his life had turned out:
”As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good...”
Hope you have a wonder-FULL Christmas.
GOD BLESS!

Interesting thot about favor and not being void of ”cost”
Thanks for sharing this.
Christmas Blessings, Wanda. thanks for being a good neighbor in 2010 :)

Hi Wanda -
This is such truth! Thank you
Our Lord tells us that in order to reign with Him, we must suffer with Him. He further informs that in the world, we
will have tribulation, but be of GOOD CHEER.
Your piece here puts things in perspective. Amen to truth.

Bernadine (2010-12-22 04:45:44)
Great post Wanda. I agree with Joanne I love that last line.
To be favored is a blessing but it is not void of cost.
I’ve always found it interesting that those who were favored by God never had an easy life. However God always
orchestrated everything to work out in the end.
Thanks for sharing.

LisaShaw (2010-12-22 13:11:50)
Amen and Amen Wanda! Powerful message!
My friend, I pray a beautiful Christmas for you and your family! See you on the other side of Christmas!
Love and blessings!

Andrea (2010-12-22 16:46:41)
Wow Wanda, this really does put a different spin on favor. We all want God’s favor in our lives but could we handle
it? I like how you show that Mary & Joseph got favor but endured hardship. I also like your reminder about Joseph
who was favored by both his earthly and heavenly fathers. He was destined to rule over his brothers but his rise to
prominence didn’t come immediately. He went through many hardships. Now when I think about God’s favor, I’m
reminded that favor doesnt always show on the outside but it does ultimately prevail.

Warren Baldwin (2010-12-22 17:39:05)
Linked from Lisa’s. Good post. Hadn’t thought about the significance of these changes for Mary.
Merry Christmas. wb

MTJ (2010-12-22 19:10:34)
Hi Wanda,
The last few days I have been meditating on Mary, Joseph and Jesus; _but particularly Mary._
How difficult it must have been for her to be ostracised from her family. To not see her mother at a time when (_even_
_as an adult_) Mary would seemingly most need her support. I think back to my mother-in-law standing there with
my wife and I as she was about to deliver our firstborn. I had no idea what to say to my wife, but her mother knew
exactly what to share, and moments later we had a son.
Mary on the other hand was relegated to a manger with no one but her husband and stock animals.
I agree that, ”**To be favored is a blessings but it is not void of cost.**”
I also want to take a moment to thank you for extending fellowship and friendship to me over these months. Your
words have often asked me to answer questions which demand honesty. You write with a genuine sincerity and passion
for Christ that serves as an example for me.
Sending you joy and blessing as you celebrate the birth of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

Wanda (2010-12-22 21:20:29)
MTJ, as often happens when you leave a comment, you’ve given me more to think about with Mary. Hadn’t considered
the impact of being away from her mother and other family members as she brought her son into the world. I’ve been
strengthen, stretched, and encouraged by our fellowship and I look forward to more in the future. God bless.
Hi Warren, glad to have you stop over from Lisa’s place. The great thing about the Christmas story or any part of
the Bible is that it is constantly unfolding to us. I’ve read the story many times but only this time did the impact of
Mary’s yes really stand out to me. Hope you & yours enjoy a very Merry Christmas.
Andrea, yes can we stand to be favored by God. Much of our life is spent preparing us that we might walk into our
favored/destined place, I believe.
Thank you Lisa, Wishing you & yours a wonderful Christmas season as well.
Thank you Bernadine. To the natural self it seems favor would mean you slide by in life but that’s totally not the
case as you’ve pointed out.
Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts Sandra. I’m always blessed when you stop by. Hope you & your family
enjoy a Merry Christmas.
Christmas blessings to you & yours Patrina.
Sharon, I’ll have to look that poem up.
Thanks Jessica, there’s always something new to discover in the Word.
One does not come without the other...oh so true Bluebutterfly.
Thanks Joanne and Yvonne. I’m so pleased with Robin’s redesign.
”rooted in faith” ...AMEN Sarah

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2010-12-23 01:37:25)
Wanda this is a very insightful post. I really appreciate the revelation the Spirit of the Lord gave you regarding

```
favor. You highlighted an aspect of Mary’s assignment that I had not given much thought. We often think only of the
positive aspects of God’s favor, but it greatly benefits us to be reminded that His assignments, His favor come with
great responsibility, great weight, and sometimes a side of discomfort. Thank you for sharing with us what the Lord
shared with you.
```

```
Faith Imagined (2010-12-24 04:58:03)
I think none of us know the cost of favor. That’s why I believe God only shows us a small portion of His plan for our
lives in the beginning. If we knew all the costs, we might not even begin the journey with Him! I know I wouldn’t!
With increased territory comes increased responsibility. So many of us want to have great influence, but we are not
willing to pay the price.
Thanks for this post! I’m glad I came back to your blog to take a look-see. Merry Christmas!

Karen (2010-12-28 21:30:32)
Wonderful insight, Wanda. Have a very blessed 2011

**Speak Up (2010-12-29 13:46)**

As I read my daily scriptures a piece of a passage of scripture from Proverbs 31:8a resonated with me.

```
Speak up for those who can not speak for themselves; (NLT)
```

[1] Immediately my mind goes to the helplessness of children. But
there are many who are without a voice. Cut on the TV, listen to radio, or sit among people and no doubt
you will hear a lot of talk. But how much of it is being used to speak for the nameless millions who are
unable to speak for themselves?
On a personal level it has me contemplating this question: Am I using my voice as an instrument for others?
I think back to all the times I was unable (and still am at times) to speak for myself due to fear. Fear has a
way of slamming a person mouth shut tight.

Lord help us to see past the smiles and hear beyond the nice platitudes of those we encounter. May we discern the hurt, pain, or hopelessness theyre unable to voice and may we bring it before you on their behalf. In Jesus name.

Kaye Swain - SandwichINK for Grandparents and Caregivers (2010-12-29 16:08:20)
Excellent points for this Word-Filled Wednesday. I’ve noticed a lot of news articles this past month that abuse of
seniors is rising - in homes and in facilities. Another important area to monitor closely, supervise well, and listen
carefully with spiritual ears, then speak up as necessary. Thanks for this timely reminder!

Andrea (2010-12-29 16:47:13)
This is so powerful. There are so many people who don’t have a voice of their own. Happy WFW!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2010-12-29 17:02:30)
I’ve seen so many in my community (homeless shelters, etc.) where they only thing hindering them from getting to
the next place in their journey was a voice. As a caregiver myself for someone who is very ill, I know that one of the
best things we can do is be a voice.
Blessings to you, Wanda.

Angel @ Finding The Inspiring (2010-12-29 18:02:12)
Thank you for this powerful message - something God has been impressing on me recently as well. God bless you and

ozjane (2010-12-30 03:55:41)
That is a super challenging verse especially in regard to prayer for organization like Christian Mission for the Blind
or CMB that work all over the world in all areas of handicaps. We need to speak up to God for them in support of
their work.
I think it is also very relevant to our neighbours and workmates.....who else pleads with God for them....who speaks
up for them at the throne of grace?

Sharon Kirby (2010-12-30 04:57:27)
I just read this verse today. I was touched by its simplicity. I agree with you - we must champion the marginalized,
comfort the brokenhearted, reach out to the lost, and always speak on God’s behalf. Even in our prayers - intercession
is SO important.
Thanks for this good word, Wanda.
GOD BLESS!

Lorna (2010-12-30 23:01:41)

Ellen aka Ella (2010-12-31 04:39:15)
So many times I feel like we are thinking similar thoughts. I typed about fear, on my recent post and I come here and
see what you said.
Amazing! You are so right,to think of the bigger picture I use to be shy, not many believe that, but I was!

MTJ (2010-12-31 04:50:43)
Hi Wanda,
There are so many silent voices that are muffled by those only want more for themselves. I am grieved to think that
I live in a world where greed and selfishness continue to dominate the collective consciousness of mankind. I am
however, encouraged that God extends grace, speaking through you and other believers in Christ.
May the coming year provide you with opportunity to continue sharing God’s grace and love.
Thank you for your friendship and fellowship.
Blessings and peace.

Wanda -
I sincerely believe that by being the voice for those that cannot speak for themselves that we are ministering to them.

```
Christians are called to help the less fortunate, the weak, the feeble, and the broken-hearted.
God will honor those efforts and blessings will come because of their faithfulness.
Excellent post. Have a Happy New Year! God bless!

**Traveling Shoes (2010-12-31 09:00)**

[1] Ever since I read Ellies post on a reverb prompt regarding
[2]travel, I have found myself pondering about the places I have travelled during the course of 2010. Not so
much the physical places, although I did do a bit of that too. Thefreedictionary.com defines travel as to go
from one place to another, as on a trip; journey or to advance or proceed.
As I reflect back over the year, I can see where I stopped along so many places. I spent some time wondering
through desert lands, where I seen no evidence of Gods presence or picture of His plan unfolding. I crotched
along the sea of complaints and sometimes I settled amidst places of comfort rather than forging ahead
courageously. There were times that tears seem to be my drink of choice.
I walked through dark days but I learned how to allow the light within to lead the way. The bands of fear
that kept me immobile were loosen. Along this years journey Ive battled the blahs, insecurity, doubt, and
weariness. With shaking knees and trembling voice, I confronted fear and completed the assignment God
gave me for the year.
I still live in the same city and in the same house. Work at the same job and attend the same church. A
part of the same family. But Im not in the same place I was at the beginning of the year. For all of the hills
and valleys I traveled thorough were needful for me.
Lord as I stand on the brink of the close of 2010, I say thank you. The journey has not always been fun or
easy but you have remained at my side. I dont know what 2011 will bring but I place my hand in yours
trusting that youll lead and guide me through.

Wishing you safe travels & Happy New Year!

probably need all 365 days of 2011 to tell the story. Meeting you in ”blogland” has certainly been one of the high
points of this year. I thank God for your sweet spirit and the timely words from your posts each week. I pray that,
with great courage and boldness, you submit yourself to a new level of glory in 2011. I’m looking forward to the
journey. God bless you!

### Chapter 2

## 2011

## 2.1 January

**The Pace Setter (2011-01-03 13:46)**

I will move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children. Genesis 33:14
The devotional for today from Streams of the Desert highlights this verse, which is Jacobs statement about
the pace, he would take when returning to meet his brother Esau. I have never walked with cattle but I
certainly have with kids and those tiny steps of theirs have a way of slowing you down. Jacob wasnt on a
leisurely stroll but was going to face his past. Finally having the nerve to do so, I would think he might want
to go ahead and get it over with thus pushing those traveling along with him to move faster. Yet he chose
to set his pace to match the cattle and children, although he already knew the terrain ahead. His brother,
Esau on the other hand was not journeying with such a caravan and could probably forge ahead faster.

It makes me think of how at times Im tempted to compare my pace in life with the sister (or brother) next
to me. It seems like I should be farther along. I should be married with 2.5 kids. I should be doing more
volunteering, more mission work, leading more groups. There are so many should be(s) one can get caught
up in when peeking into the lives of others. Whether it deals with family life, housekeeping, or blogging,
the temptation to follow someone elses pace exist. However, just as Esau and Jacobs travelling companions
differed, my baggage, my companions are uniquely my own.
Before I was born, God set the course of life for me. It is He who knows the way that I take. I have never
been this way before but God has and He knows all that the journey comprises. Because He knows me, He
knows the proper pace for me even when I think it should be faster or Id much rather slow down. I find
comfort in the writers statement below.

```
He knows that all the time and will never make you take even one step beyond what your
feet are able to endure. Never mind if you think you are unable to take another step, for either
He will strengthen you to make you able, or He will call a sudden halt, and you will not have to
take it at all. Frances Ridley Havergal from Streams in the Desert.
```

Sending you cheers as you walk (or run) along the journey and resolving to stay at my own pace.

```
Joanne Sher (2011-01-03 15:05:02)
What a wonderful reminder. Love that last line.
```

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-01-03 15:53:07)

Sharon Kirby (2011-01-03 20:20:47)
Wanda, How grateful I am for this post today. It really reached my spirit. I am so bad at comparing myself to others
- and I always seem to judge myself falling ”short.” I am going to resolve to stay at my own pace - the one that GOD
sets for me.
GOD BLESS!

Wanda, your last paragraph really hits home for me and the quote that followed! Thanks for sharing with us today!
Blessings to you on your journey...

Ellen aka Ella (2011-01-04 15:25:27)
Our own pace is all we can manage, but the way you wove in the scripture made it beautiful! It is so easy to compare
ourselves in all facets. Thanks for the reminder it is our journey, it resets our stride
xXx

lioneagle (2011-01-05 01:34:55)
Hi Wanda -
Your pace is uniquely you. Only our Lord knows precisely the pace for each one of us. I believe that your heart is in
earnest to know our Lord’s will. Truly, you will keep step with Him!
We all have our ”seasons” of uncertainty.
Surely, we return to our SOURCE to drink more of His living water....

Lisa (2011-01-06 17:42:32)
I love your new layout, Sister! Beautiful!!
This post is very timely for me and thought provoking too.
I have to often remind myself not to ”compare yourself among yourselves”, because as His word says, ”It’s not wise”.
You have this, a great ministry which I’m sure some of ”us” (LOL) compare our own blogging to and again, it just
ain’t wise.
Love you Sis!

**Headed Out, But**& **(2011-01-05 13:57)**

[1]
He was headed for the land of Canaan, but they stopped at Haran, and settled there. Terah lived for 205
years and died while still in Haron. Genesis 11:31b-32. (NLT)
Do you see the verbs in this passage of scripture?

```
HEADED&Terah started moving toward a particular place
```

```
STOPPED&but something happened and he stopped progressing toward the specified place
```

```
SETTLED&therefore, he chose to take up residence in another place
```

```
LIVED&he spent day after day in a place opposite of where he had intended
```

```
DIED&he ceased to exist any more after spending much of his life in the place of compromised.
```

I understand that we all have dreams that dont quite materialize and at times we find those dreams are
exchanged for much better God-ordained dreams. But this passage of scripture just stands out to me today.
Rather than rushing past it to the rest of chapter my eyes and mind were drawn back to these verses. As I
reflect upon them, these questions come to mind.
Where was I headed?
What caused me to stop seeking, stop desiring, or stop making progress toward that place?
Have I elected to settle at a place short of the destined place because of disappointment or fear?
Am I willing to spend the rest of my days just settling and not pursuing?
My friend, could there be some place you have settled that God longs for you to start back on the journey
toward this year?

I really like the breakdown of this verse. This year I dont want to settle for my best. I want God’s best all year
through. Great post!

Dawn (2011-01-05 20:39:09)
Wow Wanda YES I read that this morning too and your thoughts echo my own for this new year. Where am I going?
Such important things to be thinking about. Thanks for dropping by my blog this morning. :)

OH I LOVE IT!!!! Love it!! I won’t even say much more than that. I LOVE how the power of the Holy Spirit spoke
through you on this one.

theemissarysfeet (2011-01-05 22:53:11)
wow what a great revelation and a great message to reflect, i have to ask myself those questions.

Peggy (mazmagi) (2011-01-06 00:09:39)
Blessings Wanda! Powerful reflection and power packed questions on verses we may just pass by...but your analysis
from checking out the verbs is excellent! So I must ponder as well... HEADED out for but STOPPED... _where_? and
what part of my journey do I need to return and pursue? Great questions to start out my new year quest! Thank
you for such profound wisdom as you search God’s Word in your reading! Love your visual and post!
Peace and joy,
Peggy

Sharon Kirby (2011-01-06 02:02:48)
Powerful, Wanda!
I’m so glad you brought all of this out of this passage. Yes, in many ways, complacency is a tool of the enemy. We get
settled - and often, too secure - in a place that is familiar. Today, in my one-year Bible reading, these verses really
stuck out to me. I think it’s appropriate to what you’re saying here:
”The LORD had said to Abram, ’Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father’s family, and go to the
land that I will show you’...So Abram departed AS THE LORD HAD INSTRUCTED.” (Genesis 12:1, 4a)
Lord, never let me get so used to one place - physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually - that I am unwilling to
MOVE when You call...
Thanks, Wanda -
GOD BLESS!

Bernadine (2011-01-06 03:00:25)
Love those nuggets you shared from that scripture Wanda. They give much to ponder upon.

Donna (2011-01-07 02:48:19)

Wanda (2011-01-07 03:59:58)
Thank you for stopping in and sharing your thoughts. I’m honored that you were able to glean something from the
truths that struck me as I did my daily Bible reading. For any place that you have stopped prematurely, I pray that
you have the courage and strength to head again. Love & blessings to you.

Amydeanne (2011-01-07 13:38:31)
great thoughts wanda! how many times we ”forget” where we are destined for and stay else where... I’ve been feeling
like that lately and trying to get back on track! Thanks for the great post!

I also settled, fear and constantly moving, threw me off course. I had a scare last year, that woke me up...I need to
try, not wonder on my death bed,”what if”! I think we have to continue to take steps on paths, we find interesting
to keep our passion alive! It is easy to settle, I did it for a long time. It is easier than making waves...I am making
waves. Messy ones and I’m happier!

**The Unexpected (2011-01-10 13:44)**

[1] Yesterday, we got snow here in Arkansas. Although I
had heard the weathermans prediction of possible snow, I didnt quite expect his prediction to come true.
Especially when I peered out the door early Sunday morning only to see things looked exactly the same as
it did when I last saw it the evening before. So I went about getting ready for morning worship. Leaving
my driveway everything looked the same. Along the journey to church, things looked the same as well.
Entering church, outside conditions looked the same. But, somewhere between entering the sanctuary doors
and wrapping up our Sunday school class, things changed. Through the windows, we saw the fluffy white

stuff that had been announced should make its arrival.
The weatherman had predicted it but why didnt I expect it to happen? For one, we all know the weatherman
does not always get it right but another reason was because it rarely happens here. As I trekked through
the snow this morning to take Bella out, my mind is drawn to the similarities between the snow event and
our spiritual lives. Whether we hear the gospel proclaimed or open up His Word ourselves, we find many
proclaimed promises that have yet to be fulfilled in our personal lives. Unlike the weatherman, God knows
all things. He is not just making educated guesses. But I still find some places in my life where I have
been looking yet everything looks the same. I looked last week&nothing. Looked last month&nothing.
Looked last year&.nothing. Has the nothingness I see led me not to expect the fulfillment of His proclaimed
promises? Or rather have I allowed what I see with these natural eyes to damper my faith?

Oh Lord, I know that you are God and that you are sovereign. I know that you cannot lie but I find at times
my faith is just not where it should be. So I say as that father, Lord I believe but help my unbelief.

P.S. Speaking of unexpected, Yvonne at Welcome to My World of Poetry passed on the inspiration award
to me over the weekend. I appreciate the lovely award and her faithful support.

but God is working.

a sojourner (2011-01-10 17:08:29)
waiting for anything is extremely difficult for me. our Father speaks to us in so many ways. i’ve prayed your prayer
before in my own life. (i believe, but help my unbelief...) when i first went to China, i happened to discover a Chinese
proverb that when i saw it...thought, ”thank You, Lord.” He speaks to us in many ways... everytime i see fresh snow,
i’m amazed how white it is and remember that ours sins are now white as snow. ADD alert! ADD alert! the chinese
proverb:
”The oxen are slow...but the earth is patient.”
everytime i take matters into my own hands, i screw everything up. then HE has a bigger mess to deal with.
congratulations on a very deserving award!

Wanda (2011-01-10 18:13:02)
You are so right Joanne, absolutely nothing is unexpected to Him.
Yes, he does Kim.
Bluebutterfly, indeed He is at work.
Bud, I like that proverb. God’s handiwork is amazing.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-01-10 21:43:43)
We here in the UK has had the coldest December in over a hundred years.......that was unexpected but I hope it stays
away.
Enjoyed your post.
Yvonne.

Sharon Kirby (2011-01-11 02:54:46)
Such a good point, Wanda. It seems that lately I’ve been caught up in ”cloud watching” - looking at my life and
wondering why ”x, y, or z” hasn’t happened yet. Maybe it’s time to get my head out of the clouds, and just wait...God
will come through, just in the nick of HIS time!!
GOD BLESS!

Monica (2011-01-11 03:08:22)
I hear you and can very much identify with the idea of waiting but things appearing to always look the same. However,
the Lord is showing me now that situations and circumstances (just like the weather) can change in an instant. His
timing is always perfect. We just have to keep the faith and stand on the truth of His word.

Mike (2011-01-11 08:40:44)
Interesting. was listening yesterday to podcast about Jesus talking re ”you know how to read the weather, but....” He
gives us signs that we need to follow. Blessings to you Wanda!

Ellen aka Ella (2011-01-12 03:43:31)

LisaShaw (2011-01-12 15:27:27)
Very true Wanda. So important for us to keep our eyes on HIM and to live expectancy for nothing is a surprise to
GOD and I’m thankful that His promises are true...always!
You said it best here: ”Has the nothingness I see led me not to expect the fulfillment of His proclaimed promises? Or
rather have I allowed what I see with these natural eyes to damper my faith?”
Thanks for sharing Wanda! Much love!

So been there Wanda. I pray Lord I know you won’t forget me...so please don’t forget me. LOL
I also increase my thanks. Work may be hard and other things are shaky but I am healthy. I get under warm covers
each night. I know my son is asleep in the room next to mine and we are safe. I know there is food in my fridge...When
I think about those little things that others don’t have it helps me endure the wait.

lioneagle (2011-01-15 18:05:13)
Hi Wanda -
Thank you for this sincere piece.
When we are fully armored with GOD, the unexpected does NOT shake us because GOD has us covered!
Now as for those who are not fully armored, the unexpected can indeed shake them...sometimes to the core.
But prayer changes people and things.
May GOD help us all...

**Branching Beyond (2011-01-15 18:10)**

[1] Hi friends, will you join me as I branch beyond my
own blog? Lisa Shaw of [2]Sharing Life With Lisa graciously invited me to share a post as a part of Ladies
On A Mission (LOAM). Below is a snippet of the post entitled, [3]Branching Beyond that Im sharing at
Lisas place.

```
As I walked that morning just beholding the beauty of Gods creation and the awesomeness
of the trees, I could not help but notice the vividness of the colors of fall. As often happens
when I walk, I heard the gentle whisper of the Spirit of the Lord. He states that is the way He
designed my life to be-colorful. I have spent too much time living in the dullness of black and
white. Failing to embrace the full spectrum of the life He had designed for me.
```

I have been away from the blogging world for a few days but I look forward to catching up with each of you
soon. God bless.

**I Dare You to Change!** {**Giveaway**} **(2011-01-17 07:00)**

There is just something about a new year that has most people looking for and speaking about change. But
mid-year many people have given up on all those resolutions made. Pastor Bil Cornelius latest book, I Dare
You to Change, helps us not just talk about change but gives us a 10-step battle plan to make change a
reality in our lives.

About the book:

[1] I Dare You To Change! was released in September 2010 and has already
become a **USA Today** and **Wall Street Journal National Best Seller** with over 60,000 books in print!

A no-holds-barred motivational action plan that shows you how to take charge of your life and find God’s
best for you from one of the most exciting new pastors in America! _Why can’t I ever get ahead? Why do I_
_always have to settle for less than I planned?_ Most of us have asked ourselves these questions at one time
or another. Pastor Bil Cornelius firmly believes that everyone wants to do better, live better, and to be a
better person but we find it difficult to sustain a life of peace and fulfillment. In _I Dare You to Change!_
Pastor Cornelius explains in his trademark winning style how to live the life that God has planned for us. In
this inspiring and biblically oriented book, he shows us the difference between dreaming of a better life and
actually living one. Using the story of Gideon from the book of Judges, he shows you how to re-imagine life
and to understand the steps that you need to take each day to make it happen.
Currently I find myself in the midst of change and at times I feel overwhelmed by all that needs to be done.
When asked how someone could go about changing their life when they feel overwhelmed, Pastor Bil gives
the following advice.

```
The first step when wanting to change something in your life, especially if overwhelmed, is to
pray, and break it down into bite-size chunks of change. The prayer part is obvious, but most
people dont do it. Prayer releases Gods confidence in you, so you have the vision and power
from God to move forward. What comes next is a good strategy: if something is overwhelming
you, its typically because we are thinking of changing everything at once (or one really large
change) rather than breaking into a series of smaller changes. You may not be able to own a
high rise in New York City, but you can buy a small fixer-upper home, work on it, get it rented,
then do it again. If you are consistent enough with this, then within a few years you can sell it,
take your profits and reinvest them into a 4 to 6 unit. Sell this a few years later, and you can
invest into a 15 to 20 unit. Sell this a few years later and reinvest into a small office building.
Sell this&you get the point. Its all about taking baby steps first. Another angle is if you want
to lose 50 pounds, lose 5 first and keep going.
```

**Broken but Useable (2011-01-19 07:00)**

But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not us. 2
Corinthians 4:7

[1]

Attempting to carry something of value in a broken container is counterintuitive. Yet it’s amazing that God
chooses to use broken people like myself to carry the essence of Himself.

Loved this picture -
And yes, God works in counterintuitive ways. His Wisdom seems foolish to the world. That’s at least ONE of the
reasons I love Him so...
Those broken containers?
They’re still broken, but Jesus sealed them with His Blood and they are filled to abundance with the Holy Spirit!
GOD BLESS!

**Monday Manna (2011-01-24 11:59)**

[1] Linking up with Joanne at [2]An Open Book for Monday Manna. Todays verse
comes from Matthew 13:58 And he(Jesus) did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith. As
I reflect on this passage, the following stand out to me:

• Jesus had the capacity to do more than He did.
• The peoples faith limited the manifestation of miracles in their own lives and community.
• People from a certain geographically region missed out on what was available to them because they
could not get pass their familiarity with the vessel that God was using.

Which leads me to ask myself do I have His hands tied in certain areas of my life due to unbelief? And,
what have I been missing out on because my inability to see beyond the package God has chosen to wrap
the miracle in?

Wanda, thanks for joining in Monday Manna. Yes, this verse is very ”soul-searching”, isn’t it?
```

```
Joanne Sher (2011-01-24 16:12:24)
Oh - I never thought of the ”package” aspect of this. I think I’m pretty awful about inspecting the messenger rather
than the message. thanks for the reminder!

I just read that chapter a couple days ago. Its powerful and made me ask the same questions. Thanks for sharing
```

```
Wanda (2011-01-25 07:51:37)
Hi Belbin9, good to hear from you. It’s good to look beyond the text of the Word and find ourselves in it.
Sandra, blessings to you my sister.
Sharlyn, thank you.
Kim, just be sensitive to His leading and He’ll surely direct you.
Joanne, I’ve been guilty of that myself.
Yvonne, it’s my pleasure to take part in Monday Manna when I can. Always interesting to see what others glean from
the same passage of scripture.
```

```
Sharon Kirby (2011-01-25 23:59:08)
Food for thought, Wanda -
Where is God most at work? Maybe, just maybe, where I least see it...
Asking the Lord to make me more spirit-sensitive to what He CAN do, and what He WANTS to do...
GOD BLESS!
```

```
jackie (2011-01-26 07:31:08)
when doubts overwhelmed us we become blind of the truth that God wants to reveal to us...
I can relate to this because sometimes, if not often, I tend to doubt out of fear and confusion...

**Staying Within the Lines (2011-01-31 07:00)**

I must admit its been quite some time since I have been a part of a formal school setting and grade school[1]

```
is even farther away. But I do recall how lining up and staying in the
```

line was an important part of that world. You lined up to go the restroom, cafeteria, library, or any other
destination. And for a girl whose last name is at the back of the alphabet chain, I often found myself near
the caboose of such lines. Then there was those coloring pages that we were expected to stay within the
lines.
Lines, lines, lines, and more lines. Lines create order. Lines create expectation. If I know my place in line
relative to others, I can estimate when my turn is next. But what happens when someone breaks line? For
most people, unless they are feeling extra nice that day, to be cut in front of is not a welcomed occurrence.
The account of Israels blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh found in Genesis 48 reminds me of how God often
breaks our preconceived lines. According to their tradition, the oldest son was in line for the blessing. Joseph
being the good little father that he was even attempted to help set things up so the blessing would come to
the one at the head of the line.

```
13 Then Joseph took the two boys, Ephraim with his right hand setting him to Israel’s left,
and Manasseh with his left hand setting him to Israel’s right, and stood them before him. 14
But Israel crossed his arms and put his right hand on the head of Ephraim who was the younger
and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, the firstborn. 17 When Joseph saw that his father
had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he thought he had made a mistake, so he took
hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s, 18 saying, ”That’s the
wrong head, Father; the other one is the firstborn; place your right hand on his head.” 19 But his
father wouldn’t do it. He said, ”I know, my son; but I know what I’m doing. He also will develop
into a people, and he also will be great. But his younger brother will be even greater and his
descendants will enrich nations.” Genesis 48:13-14, 17-19
```

However, Israel did a switcheroo. He skipped over the firstborn. Leading Joseph to assume he had made a
mistake. I cant tell you how may times I wrongly believed that God some how made a mistake. Didnt he
know I was next? And, there has even been those times, when he picked me but according to the natural
order of things it was not yet my time. Im so glad that God does not have to stay within the lines of our
human thinking or our man-made traditions.

love His unfathomable grace that doesn’t have a set line.

all. Well Done

Great post Wanda! I love the analogies you give to help remind us that God is sovreign ”does not have to stay within
the lines of our human thinking or our man-made traditions.”
And thanks for stopping by my place too. :)

Lisa (2011-02-01 21:06:28)
Ain’t that the truth!
We limit God with our preconceived ideas about ”how” He should do things.
Have a great week, Sister!

Sharon Kirby (2011-02-01 21:40:01)
Yes, indeed! I love that God can color ”outside the lines” but He still makes a masterpiece EVERY time!
He works in His perfect timing...
GOD BLESS!

As humans we must maintain a sense of order in order to avoid conflict and chaos, but on the larger scale God’s in
charge and He can certainly do what He wants. After all God knows best.

## 2.2 February

**Refuse to Lose Ground (2011-02-02 06:00)**

[1]

```
Only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walk and order our lives by that. Philippians
3:16 (AMP)
```

The past two weeks Philippians 3:16 has been my siesta scripture I have been memorizing. While there are
a lot of things I have yet to obtain or comprehend, this passage of scripture reminds me that as I wait on
them to materialize, I should not loose what I have already received.
Rather than focus on what is missing in your life, take a moment to do an assessment of what is in your
possession now. Do you still have a measure of faith? Then hold onto it. And dont just hold onto it but
put it to use.
Hope over to the cafÈ to find others dishing up the word for Word-Filled Wednesday.

jackie (2011-02-02 11:09:28)
You are right Wanda... we should not lose what we already have... We could be expectant but we should not dwell
much on what is yet to come.. We must instead cherish on what God presently gave us...
Thanks again for the inspiring reminders! God bless us!

Kaye Swain - SandwichINK (2011-02-02 13:17:41)

As I struggled to MOVE FORWARD all last year, I press into 2011, expecting more like JOY as I hold true to what
we have already attained!!! Let’s walk and order our lives by that!!!
Powerful and vivid image to grasp this as we wait and trust His Word, His promises, His strength, His power not
ours... So now I will reflect on what I already possess and build on my faith as I put it to use. Great brief message
and to the point with excellence and wisdom! Thank you Wanda!
Peace and JOY,

**Resisting the Urge to Run (2011-02-07 07:30)**

Moses answered the people, Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will
bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. The LORD will fight for you; you
need only to be still. Exodus 14:13-14
Exodus 14:13-14 is Joanne of An Open Book pick for this weeks Monday Manna. It provides an opportunity
for fellow bloggers to chew on the same scripture passage and share their insights.
Most of us are probably familiar with the Israelites exodus from Egypt. Oppressed for hundreds of years,
they suddenly found themselves in the midst of Gods deliverance plan. However, it didnt feel or look much
like deliverance to them. In fact, it seemed foolish to leave oppressive comfort for a wilderness journey full
of the unknown. So foolish that they were complaining and seeking to go back to bondage. Not to mention
that their taskmasters were now pursing them.

When posed with danger, it is natural to be scared and to be tempted to run. Which makes Moses instructions
sound illogical and like a sure recipe for disaster. So what does it take for one to be able to follow such
unnatural instructions?

The exact same thing it takes for you and I to follow the illogical instructions, we hear uttered to us in our
daily lives. TRUST.

To stand still when everything in us wants to run.

To forge ahead when our knees are shaking.

To face our enemies instead of avoiding them.

To rely on God rather than defend ourselves.

All takes TRUST.

Not in ourselves but in the one who is with us always to the ends of the earth.

What does this passage speak to you? To find out what others are saying visit An Open Book. [1]

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-02-07 17:24:15)
The urge to run...yes, indeed. I’m one of those folks that has many pairs of running shoes (literally and symbolically),
so I can get up and go at anytime. I have, however, learned the value of standing still.

Kim-Stuff could be worse (2011-02-07 19:27:33)
I Love this scripture. It has become real to me, when I finally stood still, He did fight the battle for me!

Yvonne,

Just Be Real (2011-02-07 23:56:13)
Truth reigns in the words of this post. Blessings to you Wanda.

Sharon Kirby (2011-02-08 01:42:15)
I loved this one, Wanda. Trust is such a struggle for me. I love this passage - because it speaks to what I need to
calm my fears - just BE STILL.
I was reminded that ”in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.”
In my Bible Study, we are studying the book of Jonah. It’s been so good. He was a person who gave in to the urge
to run - and he ran as far as he could from God. But, God was there - and God rescued Jonah - and returned him to
HIS purpose.
Rely on God - the only antidote to shaking knees, and quaking hearts.
GOD BLESS!

Wanda (2011-02-08 01:45:16)
Jackie, congrats to you and I will be praying.
Yolanda, you are so right. Only when when we trust Him will we go about obeying Him.
Thanks, Joanne. Trust a small word but such a big key.
Bluebutterfly, thank goodness that He keeps on working with us and takes us from glory to glory.
Kim, stand still is hard work. Isn’t it.
Thanks, Yvonne.
JBR, blessings to you too.

Wanda (2011-02-08 01:48:22)
Sharon, there was time period God had me meditating on in quietness and confidence is your strength. You are not
alone in your trust struggle. But there is hope for the runners too. Where can we go from His presence.

Joanney (2011-02-08 03:50:47)
The urges to run, to hold back with shaking knees, to defend ourselves and to turn to others instead of God can be
so strong at times. Yet what a blessing when we TRUST God instead. Thanks for a great message.

Catrina Bradley... (2011-02-08 05:08:01)

Dean Spencer (2011-02-17 03:58:26)
Wanda -
When I was reading this I was thinking of 1 Corinthians 1:18:
”For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power
of God.”
Trust is powerful. But the Object of our trust is so much bigger.
Great post! God bless!

**My Heart****s Answer (2011-02-09 00:00)**

My heart has heard you say, Come and talk with me. And my heart responds, Lord, I am coming. Psalm
27:8 (NLT)

Like the rest of the world, there are so many things that require my attention during the course of the
day. Needful things. Critical things. Routine things. So much stuff and things that at times, I find myself
overwhelmed by it all. And, if Im not very cautious all of those things will drown out my ability to hear His
call and my willingness to answer.

[1]

Can you hear Him calling you today? Will you answer Him or leave him waiting?

1. [http://lh5.ggpht.com/_2wfF2Ki6_qg/TVIGsDSSt4I/AAAAAAAAAd4/Ol4fddcfzwY/s1600-h/Psalm-27-83.png](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_2wfF2Ki6_qg/TVIGsDSSt4I/AAAAAAAAAd4/Ol4fddcfzwY/s1600-h/Psalm-27-83.png)

```
jackie (2011-02-09 00:18:11)
Everyday I know He is waiting for me to call unto Him...
I just ignore it sometimes and could only think about Him when I have nowhere to run...
God’s reminder is very evident but I choose to disobey and ignore Him...
But He made me realize that apart from Him I AM ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
Thanks for reminding me again today... thanks for watering my soul, Wanda.
God bless...
Wish to talk to you for long in person ;)

This is such a challenge and I thought by this time of my life it would surely be habitual......but while I have a set
routine of a night...I am not awake in the mornings...although I have tried to pick up a book of daily readings first
thing......but it is so easy to get into bed.....unfortunately I can no longer kneel and spread my Bible and books over
the bed a I used to love to do........so it is easy to start reading a novel and then decide you are just too tired for the
word, your journal prayer diary etc. And that shames me when it happens.
I need to start with the word....

I listen to it first thing. But yesterday, I put if off ”For just a bit.” Next thing you know, that just a bit was bedtime,
and I lasted 5 minutes before I fell asleep. PTL - He is gracious and merciful and forgives us and gives us a NEW
DAY with NEW MERCIES, and YES I did my Bible study bright and early. :) And what a delightful way to start

As only Our Lord fills those empty pieces (in this puzzle or our lives).
Focus on the drumbeat of Our Lord and let all the other ”stuff” be drowned out, or wait and those pieces will come
together so much better just for acknowledging God’s place first in our day, in our lives, in our heart! I know you
want to so now praying that it happens, cuz we both know the delight it is for the Lord and us when our heart is full
of His love!
May He complete this WFW as you abide in Him, and He in you!
Really wonderful WFW and message!
Looks like it’s awakening some hearts! Let not our hearts be overwhelmed but overflowing! Great Psalm for this

I hear Him calling and I’m picking up the phone!!
Oh, yes, Lord - speak to me. Your servant is listening.
Thanks for sharing this, Wanda. It really made me stop and take a moment - just to be still. I needed it!
GOD BLESS!

I also try to listen, but sometimes I am confused if it is my intuitive voice or his Usually the hard stuff, I know it is
him Great point to ponder, as always! Happy Weekend!

Toia (2011-02-13 14:03:38)
This verse and post was meant for me as well. So often, I tend to get caught up with my day to day routine and not
be cautious of God’s voice like I should be. Thanks for the reminder. Blessings to you and Happy Valentine’s Day!!!

Oh so good. It sounds like the Lord is calling, doesn’t it?
I’m going to take the challenge and _listen_ more.

**Discover the Way to Love (2011-02-14 16:56)**

[1]

**Ephesians 5:1-2 MSG:** Watch what God does, and then you do it, like children who learn proper behavior
from their parents. Mostly what God does is love you. Keep company with him and learn a life of love.
Observe how Christ loved us. His love was not cautious but extravagant. He didn’t love in order to get
something from us but to give everything of himself to us. Love like that.

Happy Valentines Day

Hi Wanda,
I just got around to visiting your blog and found these wonderful words, ”Watch what God does...what God
does is love you...His love was not cautious but extravagant...to give everything of himself to us.”
Thank you for encouraging me to love like that.
Blessings and peace.

**When is long better than short? (2011-02-21 13:48)**

Being what I call directionally challenged, I often go the route I know best rather than run the risk of getting
lost. Times when I felt rather daring I have ventured down unchartered territory and on several occasions
I have discovered that for months I had been going the long way around. I wasted needless time and gas
going the sure way.

```
When Pharaoh finally let the people go, God did not lead them along the main road that runs
through Philistine territory, even though that was the shortest route to the Promised Land.
```

Now God is not directionally challenged like me but even He, the all-knowing one, had people take the long
way around. Everything He does is purposeful.

```
God said, If the people are faced with a battle, they might change their minds and return
to Egypt. So God led them in a roundabout way through the wilderness toward the Red Sea.
Exodus 13:17
```

Going the long way around processed the Israelites for possession of the promise. Had they went the short
route, perhaps they would have visited the land but certainly would not have had the stamina to maintain
it.

Dear Lord, forgive me for all the times Ive assumed that I really know best. Forgive me for all the times
I have murmured and complained about what is yet to manifest in my life. For your promises are yea and
Amen. You already know my final destination but it is me that you are preparing for it as I go along the
journey of life. Thank you that you know the way that I take. Im never out of your eyesight or reach of
your loving hands.

Father I pray for my fellow brothers and sisters as they walk along the course you have set for them. May
they be ever mindful that you are with them whether they find themselves wearily walking the long road or
speeding down the fast track. Strengthen them I pray. May they have renewed confidence in You, Lord. In
Jesus name, Amen.

```
Joanne Sher (2011-02-21 14:42:01)
Wonderful reminder. Thanks for this!
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-02-21 15:01:31)
Oh, Wanda, I was falling out of my chair about being directionally challenged. Thank God for His grace...really. ”I
am reminded of a favorite verse: By your endurance you will gain your lives.” - Luke 21:19
```

```
One Heart (Marcia) (2011-02-21 15:19:02)
Oh, Wanda, this is so on target for me today after a very challenging week last week AND weekend too. I began to
look for the promises that have not manifested and the thorn that is still in place after a lifetime and it only brought
me pain. Just this morning I shared with friends how some promises we will simply not see this side of heaven, BUT,
Heaven lives in us and He is all we need. I also commented to them that instead of praying for the thorn to be
removed, we should always pray that the abundant grace which has already been given to us would be revealed to us
more profoundly because with it, although the thorn is not removed, it will no longer sting us.
Thank you for your visit. Always good to stop by. Love your blog design. Blessings!

Wanda, dear Wanda - I just took this prayer of yours, and quietly let you pray it over me. I so needed it tonight.
Thank you for your wise and encouraging words. God takes us down just the right path, at just the right pace - yes,
this gives me renewed confidence!
GOD BLESS!
```

```
Tina C (2011-02-24 12:50:40)
I enjoyed your post. I’m directionally challanged too. That’s why I have to seek God so much about what road to
take or what turn to make. Lately, I’ve been thinking more of the process. There is a reason for the path (long or
short) He gives us. After all He has to prepare us for the war and the victory that lies ahead. He will be our guide
even unto death...
```

```
Carole in the Faith Lounge (2011-02-25 04:13:07)
Wanda, LOL. That first paragraph is me all over. Sonetimes, I take the long route in order that I can have some
thinking and reflection time!! Strange but true.
Thank you so much for your prayer, which came straight from the heart of God.
Keep sweet in the Lord.

”May they have renewed confidence in You, Lord. In Jesus name, Amen.”

Mike (2011-03-01 11:09:06)
That’s really helpful. God is more interested in the process and how it changes us more than the destination? Very

**Review: iShine Bible (2011-02-22 08:00)**

Designed specifically for tweens, the iShine Bible packs a lot of punch in a small pink or blue package. I
chose to review the one for girls and loved the girly designs on the Bible cover. Its size of 6.13 x4.13 inches
makes it a perfect to carry along in a purse or bag without being weighted down.

It uses the New Living Translation, which I find to be one of my favorite translations. It features 3 color
sections that focuses on helping tweens to realize they are V.I.P(s). Meaning they are valued with a unique
identity in Christ and called to a specific purpose. The front of the Bible is filled with helpful information
about growing in their spiritual walk and a topical index addressing common questions tweens may have.
Additionally, it incorporates multimedia by using links to videos and/or QR codes that are readable by
smartphones.

Overall, I think the iShine Bible is one any tween would enjoy. For me, I wish it contained more culturally
diverse tween photos. Since it is a compact Bible, the writing is small; however, most tweens would not find
that to be a problem for their young eyes.

From your review, Wanda, it sounds like a Bible I should check out, when it becomes available here in the UK.
I love my NLT Bible and always suggest it as a version for new christians. (after the NIV), it is great that there is
now a new desigh for Tweens.
God Bless

**The Life Ready Woman (2011-02-26 14:23)**

Are you a doing it all or doing what matters most kind of girl?

For me I often find myself overwhelmed by the burden of trying to get it all done. And to think that I dont
even have near the responsibilities of those of other woman, who are balancing motherhood, marriage and
ministry. In The Life Ready Woman: Thriving in a Do-It-All World authors Shanti Feldhahn and Robert
Lewis asks us women to examine our lives in light of Gods design.

```
The freedom to excel can also lead us to take on burdens we were never meant to carry, to
find ourselves stressed and torn, and to experience an outlook that that is all too often marked
by worry or guilt instead of the absolute peace of knowing we are in the exact center of Gods
will every day.
```

The book is divided into two parts. Part 1: Gods Plan and Purposes for All of Us and Part 2: Getting to
Gods Best for You. Authors point out that all humankind has been issued a call by God to leave and cleave,
be fruitful and multiply and subdue and rule. In addition to our universal call, the book states that women
share feminine callings to:

• help
• influence our setting
• nurture life
• bring special wisdom and perspective
• multitask.

As affirming as learning about and embracing these feminine calls may be, women are warned that these
callings can leave us vulnerable to sinful tendencies such as manipulation, being controlling, and resisting
set limits.

Part two focuses on living in view of our callings and how to be better stewards of our personal gifts by
reliance on God.

```
Its so easy to default to walking the path that we already know rather than the one God is
leading us to.
```

What I like about the book:

It addresses the many faucets of womanhood from married women to the older single woman, who each faces
a very different set of circumstances. The authors did not sugarcoat the fact that to really live according to
Gods design requires self-sacrifice and obedience, which is not always popular or easy.

Wanda - sounds like a great book. It’s speaking about many of the issues I was thinking and blogging about last week.
As a woman, I need to mindful of my priorities and activities. As a Christian woman, I need to rely on the Holy
Spirit to help me sort it all out. Because the devil will also attempt to get me so, so busy, that I burn out and become
useless for the Lord’s work.
Thanks for sharing this.
GOD BLESS!

**What to Wear? (2011-03-02 14:10)**

Wondering what to wear today? God has something special picked out for you today. Nope, you will not
find it hanging in your closet beside your favorite pair of jeans. But it is just as essential as your go to black
dress. For a glimpse of Gods favorite attire on you:

Colossians 3:12: So chosen by God for this new life of love, dress in the wardrobe God picked out for you:
compassion, kindness, humility, quiet strength, discipline. (The Message)

Peggy (mazmagi) (2011-03-02 18:10:19)
Blessings Wanda... How intriguing!
Love how you stripped down to the basics and picked out the BEST wardrobe in God’s Word! Truly a divine clothing...
but I’m not too sure how often I pick these out of my closet and put them on! Oh yes, I may prefer them as my
favorite attire but how often do others see and admire these bare essentials in my persona:
Compassion (most likely,but my how the enemy likes to use this one)
Kindness (not visible to those who had to live with me daily)
Humility (more now than in the past, but even thinking so makes me a bit prideful)
Quiet strength (only of the Lord when HE is able when I am weary or weak)
Discipline (a constant necessity to keep my life in order but also a struggle)...
Guess I need to hang this verse on my closet door daily! Thanks for sharing and I pray that God helps me get dressed
more often. I’m to use to wearing the bare necessities.
Always inspirational Messages here.
Love,peace and JOY,
Peggy

He has also promised that He will restore us to health and heal any wounds.
I Praise Him!!

**Better Than Hamburger Helper (2011-03-07 13:59)**

Looking for a way to dress up that lone package of ground beef? General Mills offers individuals a quick
and easy way to present that ground beef in a more tasty manner. Wikipedia states that the contents of

the box are combined with[1] browned hamburger meat, water, and
milk (something the cook has to have on a hand already) to create a complete dish.

In the same way, God has given the believer a prayer helperthe Spirit. When we combine the Spirit with
our weaknesses and willingness to pray, we have a prayer that is complete and free of selfish ambition and
manipulation. The Spirit knows the mind and heart of the Father and only prays according to His perfect
will.

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the
Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. Romans 8:26 NIV

Joanne, it’s funny the things God often uses to illustrate a point to me. Michelle happy to have you stop by for a
visit. Pleasure to meet you & hope you’ll stop by again soon.Bluebutterfly may we each have a renewed thirst and
hunger for Him. Yvonne thank you. Kim the best helping hand we could ever have ;)Karen yes it is. God knew
just want we would need and He provided the solution. Joanney love the idea of prayer pantry. We really do have
all the fixins :)

B. Niles (2011-03-09 21:04:56)
Hi Wanda,
Great thought for the day. It’s amazing to me how God uses everyday activities or fixins to teach us about the spirit
realm. It’s those little things that give us just the right food for thought and food for the spirit.
God Bless.

**Not Left to My Own Devices (2011-03-14 12:47)**

”For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13, NKJV)

I remember the first time I discovered this verse and really contemplated its meaning. I had a light bulb
moment. Not only did God give me new desires but He equips me with the power/ability to follow through

and act upon those desires. He does not leave me to depend upon my will power alone.

Which happens to be a good thing because sometimes, if truth be told, I dont have the will to do what
pleases Him. I had much rather cling to self-righteousness than to forgive like He commands of me. So He
has to do a work on my will. I dont think its mere coincidence that the scripture lists will first. Without
having first the mind to do, we will never get busy with the doing.

Most things God calls us to do goes against our natural inclination but He gives us the power to do them.
Whose power are you relying on to get things done?
desire + power + my cooperation = accomplishment
if anything is missing from the equation nothing really gets done.
desire  power + my cooperation = frustration
power - desire = no cooperation from me
For God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey him and the power to do what pleases him. Phil
2:13 (NLT)
Lord, I thank you that you are at work within me at this very moment. Thank you for giving me the
willingness and the power to obey your word. I pray for my fellow brothers and sisters and those that are
lost. Align our wills with your will God. Helps to remember you have already provided what we need to
please you. We choose to accept the gift and we cooperate with the work you are doing within in us. In
Jesus name. Amen.

**Up for a Challenge? (2011-03-15 12:10)**

Life throws us a bunch of challenges. Most times we dont have the option of choosing which ones we will
gladly accept and the ones we had rather pass. But every now then, you do get a choice. This April [1]Arlee
Bird is giving bloggers around the world the opportunity to build a little blogging muscles with the return
of the A to Z Challenge.

[2]
Participants are challenged to write a blog post, relating to the letter of the day, everyday except for Sunday
during the month of April. I know, I know you are already juggling a bunch of to do(s) so why would any
sane person take on such a feat? As a newbie blogger last year, I chose to join the first A to Z Challenge.
Now I had no clue as to what I was really getting into but it proved worth my while. Heres a few of the
benefits I received.
Good community support. I met such a welcoming community of bloggers through the challenge and several
of them I continue to maintain virtual friendships.
Wider blog reach. When I started writing down my thoughts in a blog, I couldnt begin to imagine that

others would find value in my writing. Through the blog challenge my blog readership moved beyond the
support of my sister to many around the world. Im still in awe every time I read a comment from someone
who has read my thoughts.
Focused regularity. Although a letter theme can leave things pretty wide open, it helped to give me focus
and to get in the habit of writing on a regular basis. As you can see from the looks of things around here, I
have kind of gotten out of the habit of writing regularly.
And the best part is you dont have to change your blogs ultimate focus. All types of bloggers participate
from poets, authors, cooks to those with a spiritual theme.

influence and teaching us things we would not otherwise know.

**Still I Sing (2011-03-16 13:14)**

[1]
Inspired by the song of the birds
Been through the stark darkness of the night
Wasnt sure if Id ever see the slightest crack of light

but still I sing

Devastation and destruction surrounds me
Im not even able to take flight
But even now I choose to sing!

Betrayed and wounded my wings find no strength to soar
Things appear hopeless but I dare to dream theres so much more
But today I still sing

I sing not because all is good
Rather Im thankful that things are not as it could
I sing because You are worthy
So whether in a whisper or in an exuberant voice
to sing unto You is an easy choice.

**I am**& **(2011-03-24 09:51)**

How would you finish that statement today? Would it be tired, weary, confused, scared or disappointed?
Go away ahead and answer it honestly. Its just between you and the Father and no matter if your I am
statement is positive or negative, Hes not intimidated by your I am(s).

Let all that I am wait quietly before God, for my hope is Him. Psalms 62:5 (NLT)

[1]

If I am weary

am confused

am sick

am hurt

am disappointed

I will not attempt to hide it but will bring it before Him.

Even if I am scornful

am lustful

am prideful

am bound

That too will I bring to Him. Yes, it will wait with me. Why? Because He is our only hope for true strength,
peace, healing, deliverance or lasting change.

The Lord already knows our heart but as we surrender it in honesty to Him, we allow Him to come in and work. Our
burden is given to Him. What a relief!
It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Used to see you at WFW at the Internet Cafe. Would love to have you stop by
and visit me.
Blessings,

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2011-03-24 19:21:28)
It’s amazing how potent 2 small words can be. We can go to Him with our ”i am” in the flesh, and He can remind
us of His ”I am”. He can remind us of our ”I am” that only comes through Him. Through Him, our ”I am” becomes
something altogether different, altogether lovely. I am a child of the most High God. I am royalty. I am a princess,
daughter of the King of Kings. I am more than a conqueror. I am the head and not the tail. I am strong in the power
of His might. I am persuaded. I am convinced. I am loved.

**Keep it Tied Tight (2011-03-29 07:25)**

Behind those crisp pages a new story unfolds. There lies a new truth to be discovered. Big ones, little ones,
entertainment ones, or enlightening ones&I am never too far away from a book. Even with all the advances
in technology, I still prefer to clutch them in my hands.

Today as I read this passage in Deuteronomy 29:18, So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words
of mine. Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders, I was reminded of the

importance of ma king THE BOOK the number one book I keep grasped in
my hands.

His Word was not meant to be tucked away on shelves only to be brought out on special days of the week.
The more our hands are found tied to His Word the more seeps down into the crevices of heart. And just
when life dishes out something you think you cant handle, the Holy Spirit brings to your remembrance a
word&the Word that sustains, comforts, guides or corrects.

May a hunger for His Word be stirred a fresh in each of us today.

## 2.4 April

**Angles, Arrows, & Awards (2011-04-01 05:01)**

[1]
Copyright (c) [2]123RF Stock Photos
Angles
I remember studying angles in geometry class. Some were narrow, many were wide and others were right
angles. Each blogger has their own unique angle. According to Wikipedia the world wide web is infested
with with over 156 million public blogs. Now thats a bunch of talking and writing going on. But what
determines the right angle for you? Some blogs focus in on a narrow selection of topics, while others have a
wide scope. Whats your blogging angle? Is it acute or obtuse?
Today, I jump in with more than 500 other bloggers into the triathlon of blogging challengesthe [3]A to
Z Challenge. As with any course, each blogger will face it their unique way. Throughout the challenge The
Watered Souls angle will remain narrow in its focus on sharing inspirational truths I learn as I journey
throughout this course of life.
Whether you like to swim around and discover broad topics or prefer the calm waters of a small pond of
ideas, you are bound to discover some new blogs through the many participants.
Arrows
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Psalms 127:4
This passage of scripture came to mind today. I dont have any children and uhmm you cant really call 30s
young but I walked away with some fresh insight. An arrow is meant to hit a target and if the one who is
shooting the arrow is mighty and/or skillful, He has the ability to reach his goal. Children are fruit that is

produced. A parents job is to help aim that child in the direction that it should go. Our relationship status
or family roles do not exempt us from birthing out or producing something of purpose in our lives. It does
not matter if we are birthing blogs, books, poems, art or clothing lines, we have to use the skills we have
been given to aim it in the proper direction.
Is there something in your life that needs to be readjusted?
Awards
On another note Id like to take the opportunity to thank those who have so graciously bestowed awards to
this blog.

Thanks to Yvonne for passing along the Friends for the Journey award. [4] Im passing
it on to Kim of [5]Stuff Could Always Be Worse.

And thanks to Jackie for giving me the Stylish Blogger award awh[6] ile ago. I would like
to pass this one on to JBR of [7]Just Be Real and Sandra of [8]Lions Share Majesty.

Thanks to Dierdra & Pam for passing along the [9] Inspiring Blog award.

Im sharing this one with Carole of [10]The Faith Lounge, Sharon of [11]Sharon Sharing God and B. Niles
of [12]Wealth of Character.
Hard to believe it has been a year since I dived head first into the last A to Z challenge. Couldnt help taking
a peek at my last years post for the letter A, which was about [13]availability. Sending out cheers to my
fellow challengers.

**Bury the Excuses (2011-04-02 11:47)**

What is that thing you started out with good intentions and enthusiastic zeal? But some where between the
start and finish, the excuses began piling up.
Im too tired.
Im too busy.
I dont have time.
I need help.
Blah, blah, blah&you know all the excuses you use for just not following through. In order to accomplish
our dreams, there just comes a point where you have to be willing to bury all the reasons why you cant and
decide that you can and will do what it takes.
He said to another person, ”Come, be my disciple.” The man agreed, but he said, ”Lord, first let me return
home and bury my father.” Jesus replied, ”Let those who are spiritually dead care for their own dead. Your
duty is to go and preach the coming of the Kingdom of God.” Another said, ”Yes, Lord, I will follow you,
but first let me say good-bye to my family.” But Jesus told him,”Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and
then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God.”
In Luke 9:59-62, we see two men giving Jesus an excuse that seem reasonable for not immediately keeping
their word to follow him. Who would not want to attend their fathers funeral or say goodbye to their families
before leaving on a journey? But surprisingly He showed no leniency for grief or goodbyes. At first glance
His response seems harsh to me but perhaps He took that attitude with them because He could see beyond
their logical sounding reasons to the real issue at heart.

I love The Message version of verse 62, which states, Jesus said, ”No procrastination. No backward looks.
You can’t put God’s kingdom off till tomorrow. Seize the day.” Will you bury the excuses today and make
the most of the gift of this day?

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-02 13:24:41)
Yes. This morning, instead of regretting the extra pound, I actually walked a few extra miles. Small achievement in
my goal of consistent progress in all things, but at least I did not look back.
Have a blessed day, Wanda.
```

```
Wanda (2011-04-02 13:32:17)
That’s really all one can do Carole.
Way to go Bluebutterfly. Keep moving.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-04-02 13:36:28)
A good B post Wanda, I agree it takes longer to think of excuses than put some effort into our dreams.
Yvonne.

septembermom (2011-04-02 13:36:38)
Wow! You gave me a good push to think in a clearer way about where I am right now. Thank you! I’m so happy

also think that Jesus saw beyond their words...He knew there hearts. They were only offering excuses.
And how many times in my own life have I done the same? Great reminder to put aside the excuses and obey!
Blessings,

_did in the rebellion._

**Choosing to See Chariots (2011-04-04 11:33)**

What do you see when faced with problems? Victory or defeat? Do you see it as something that you are
passing through or as something that will forever be at your side? We all can quote the victory chant when
the end can easily be seen but as the days turns to weeks and weeks turn to months and months to years,
there is a tendency to loose the cheer and lose our ability to see change coming.

[1] Reading todays devotional from Streams in the Desert re-
minded me that it is my choice on how I view the test and trials that come my way. Will I see them as
chariots transporting me from places of immaturity to maturity, weakness to strength, indifference to com-
passion, lameness to mobility? Or will I refuse to confront them and see them only as boulders crushing
down upon me keeping me locked in, tied up and shut out?

Can I share with you the portion that caused my mind to go a churning this morning as I read?

```
Once our eyes are opened by God, we will see all the events of our lives as, whether great or
small, joyful or sad, as a chariot for our souls. Everything that comes to us becomes a chariot
the moment we treat it as such. On the other hand, even the smallest trial may become an object
crushing everything in its path into misery and despair if we all it.
The difference then becomes a choice we make. It all depends not on the events themselves
but on how we view them. If we simply lie down, allowing them to roll over and crush us, they
become an uncontrollable car of destruction. Yet if we climb into them, as riding into a car of
victory, they become the chariots of God to triumphantly take us onward and upward. Hannah
Whitall Smith
```

Now I know that life can throw some pretty difficult challenges our way and sometimes for the life of me I
cant see anything but doom and gloom. But it is at those times that I can pray, Lord open my eyes that I
might see.

Wonderful Wanda, it is how we look at situations whether vistory or the other is ahead.
Speaking of challenges in life this one is far bigger than anticipated don’t you think?

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-04 15:10:13)
Glory Hallelujah!! Such an on-time word, which reminds me of some of my meditation from 2 Corinthians 5 this
weekend:

4. While we live in these earthly bodies, we groan and sigh, but its not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies
that clothe us. Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life.
5. God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit.
6. So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with
the Lord.
7. For we live by believing and not by seeing...
16. So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from
a human point of view. How differently we know Him now!
17. This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has
begun!

Lisa (2011-04-04 17:56:32)
Amen! I want to keep my focus on God and see things through His eyes. Nothing is too big for Him.

Ella (2011-04-04 19:24:10)
Beautiful Wanda! Now pass me some cherry coke(C’mon it give me a bit of courage) No, really this is a wonderful
post. Some of the challenges I’m having right now, make me feel mowed over. You give me insight to remember the
grass will grow and I need to tend to it! Thank you @_>_—-

Dear Wanda,
What does not slay us, makes us stronger. God is ever here, to give us support and help us over the rough times, and
to give us blessings even when we don’t see them. Thank you for the uplifting post.
Ruby

Lorena G. Sims (2011-04-04 21:45:47)
What an encouraging post Wanda! It is indeed that God gave us freedom to choose. It is up for us to choose on how
to deal with things that comes our way. God is always with us, just have faith and trust him. Thanks for a wonderful
post.

Pam (2011-04-04 22:16:42)
Beautiful, Wanda. This is a message we all need to tuck inside our hearts for those days (weeks, months, years) of
trial. Thank you so much!

Wanda (2011-04-05 02:20:18)
Appreciate the thoughts you shared. Ella, there’s a cherry coke waiting for you dear.

Sharon Kirby (2011-04-05 03:11:47)
Great word, Wanda!
I was reminded of these verses in 1 Kings 6:
”Then Elisha prayed, ’O LORD, open his eyes and let him see!’ The LORD opened the young man’s eyes, and when
he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.”
The secret is looking UP!!
GOD BLESS!

Stuff could always be worse (2011-04-06 01:55:46)
The challenges will come so we need to keep this attitude

Elizabeth West (2011-04-07 01:29:53)
I wish I could be as positive as you. I’m usually positive that God is really ticked off at me for something. If only I
knew what it was, I could fix it and we could just dump the crap and MOVE ON. LOL!

**He****s Into the Details (2011-04-05 23:32)**

[1]

After a long day of work Im drained but I dare not bow out of the A to Z Challenge this early. Thus I am
keeping it simple and sharing a scripture that encourages me on days like this.

Psalms 37:23 The steps of the godly are directed by the LORD. He delights in every detail of their lives.
(NLT)

It is awesome when you think about it. The God who holds the universe together is concerned about the
details of my life. No matter to trivial to Him. Im His daughter.

**Entries & Exits (2011-04-06 14:47)**

The letter of the day is E. Not a lot of E-words come to mind other than eyes, emotion, exude, emote,
and excel. Rather than use any of those I have decided to focus on the es that keep coming up in my

reading-entry and exit.

As the Israelites where traversing from Egypt in route to the place of promise, several warnings were issued
about how to act when they finally entered the land. In summary, they were advised of three key areas:

1. Obedience
2. Temptation to Compromise
3. Keeping First Things First

Failure in these areas meant the difference in them just entering but only passing through and them entering
in and being established. Are these not the exact challenges we each encounter today when faced with the
opportunity to enter and occupy new places in our lives? Does not matter if the new place is a relationship,
career, ministry endeavor, or hobby. We will have to fight tendencies to want to do things our own way
rather than obey Gods voice. If we do not stay alert, areas of compromise will creep in. Seeing how others
do it will have us venturing off the path set out for us. And, the busyness, pleasure, and perks of the good
place can squeeze out our time for the one who made it all possible.

Entering into a place by nature means we are exiting out of another. Some places I have exited with regret
and others with enthusiasm. Just as some places in life I have entered feeling elated but others with a bit
of mixed emotions. Regardless of the emotions, I dont want to be forced to exit the places of promise
prematurely because I failed to keep the proper balance.

Oh my..this speaks to my heart! Thank you!! I need to keep the proper balance!

**Focus (2011-04-07 05:01)**

[1]

What do you give the most focus? Wikipedia defines focus as selectively concentrating on one aspect of the
environment while ignoring other things. When we spend most of our time tuned into what is wrong in the
world, we easily miss all the good things that surrounds us every day.

Hi Wanda -
How interestng that you have the topic FOCUS. I just finished reading on another blog the words, ”Focus, Focus,
```

Focus.”
Your words here are so important to keep in mind. GOD is the SOURCE - all else is resource material. Truly, we
need to keep that truth in focus.
GOD FIRST - all else after...
Matthew 6:33 - KJV
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”
Thank you, dear friend, for sharing this rich FOCUS message.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-07 17:15:35)
As a photography junkie, ”focus” got my attention. I’ve taken lots of photos of weeds over the years, and have come
to realize that when I really focus and get that shot, most are really pretty and no longer look to me like something
to be rooted out of the garden as useless.

Penned Pebbles (2011-04-07 17:48:49)

Carole in the Faith Lounge (2011-04-11 03:31:13)
I was delighted to read this post, Wanda, as the word focus has been popping up in many areas of my life lately,
therefore I know the Lord is telling me something.
Even as I write this comment, I am looking at the little post it notes on my PC monitor that remind me that ’What
you focus on expands’ and ’Stay focused on your current task’.
With so much happening around us, it is so easy for the things of the world, to crowd out the still small voice of our
Heavenly Father.
Be blessed, Carole

**How does your garden grow? (2011-04-08 13:17)**

[1] Have you notice how easy it is to gripe rather than
express gratitude? As I read The Message version of Colossians 3:15 ( Let the peace of Christ keep you in
tune with each other, in step with each other. None of this going off and doing your own thing. And cultivate
thankfulness.) one day, I kept been drawn to the word cultivate. It made be think of gardening and how one
has to work hard at breaking up the ground before planting seeds. But the work of gardening doesnt just
stop when the seeds are sown but it requires continuous care to keep the weeds from snuffing out the life of
the good plants.
Thinking about gardening brings up memories of my grandmother, she meticulously tended and groomed
her garden and kept her grounds free of leaves. I often wondered why she was so obsessed with raking the
leaves. Back then it seemed like she was out picking up leaves daily even when you could easily count just
5 or 6 leaves floating around. Persistent and consistent in her watch of the landscape, she did not allow the
weeds or leaves to overtake her ground.
Like my grandmother or Big Mama as we called her, I need to be ever on the look out for things that would
come to smother out gratitude in my life. It does not take much effort to think of something to complain
about but I have to work at seeing the good and expresses thanks for it. Rather easy to take a peek at
another persons garden and get excited about the glitz and glam of their fruit but when is the last time you
have examined the good fruit of your ground? Romans 12:6b says, in his grace, God has given us different
gifts for doing certain things well. Have you thought about that [2]grace? I always thought of grace from the
perspective of underserved mercy and salvation and that certainly defines grace. But His grace also equips
me with certain gifting. Can I be honest for a moment? I am guilty of looking at the gift of others and
sizing myself up as coming up short. I so wish I had the gift of gab (as I call it) like my mom or the gift of
encouragement like my sister but I was not graced with it. So I can either gripe about it while neglecting
my own [3]gifts or I can get about the business of cheering them on while cultivating my gifts.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-08 16:38:52)
The gift of grace is such a wonderful blessing, and so important to growing and grooming life’s garden. My dad was
much like your grandma. I never really understood why he put so much work into his gardens until I got old enough to
understand what happens when a garden was planted and left to run wild. I realized that good intention in planting
was not enough. It required work, work and more work...constantly.
```

```
Lisa (2011-04-08 18:36:17)
We are all parts of the body. God made each of us different and gave us different gifts. We need to make sure we are
using those gifts instead of focusing on others gifts.
Have a blessed weekend, Wanda!

Wanda - what a great word! Yes, I have been guilty of checking out other people’s gardens, and being envious of
them. And then, looking at mine, and getting very discouraged. I am not proud of that - but just being honest.
However, if I’m looking at other gardens, I’m probably not tending to mine, you know?? Yes, your advice is perfect.
Cheer on our brothers and sisters, thank God for His grace - and ask Him to help us grow as much as possible in our
own garden!
GOD BLESS!

Penned Pebbles (2011-04-09 04:28:16)
Wonderful post! I like working in the garden. I even like pulling weeds! I’m strange like that. :-) And you’re so right,

Hi Wanda -
Wow! Imagine my surprise when I came here tonight and noticed your topic’s title.
Just yesterday I did a post titled, ”HOW DOES OUR GARDEN GROW?” We have a one word difference in our titles.
I wonder what our Lord is doing with this garden message...?
```

**The How(s) (2011-04-09 12:58)**

How?

I must have asked the question a million times or more

How could it be? How is it that it it didnt work for me?

I read your Word loaded with promises.

So many good things you promise

But my eyes do not see.

The clock keeps ticking away and it seems there is absolutely no way.

Shattered pieces, disappointment, broken trust fills my days.

Staring at my reality the chasm between the two seems to grow larger day after day.

I have got my eyes looking at the wrong places and faces.

The how doesnt matter; its the who that makes all the difference

Because you are who you say, I can throw away all the questions of how.
Not how but the question is who am looking unto?
When doubts filled my mind, your comfort gave me renewed hope and cheer. Psalm 94:19NLT
For surely you have a future ahead of you; your hope will not be disappointed. Proverbs 23:18 NLT

**Interruptions or Invitations? (2011-04-11 11:51)**

[1] The A-Z challenge resumes with the letter I today. Today I tackle
the word interruptions. Im not one to operate from a written to-do list but on most days I have a mental
idea of what things I hope to accomplish. Yet its rare to have a day without some form of interruption.
Sometimes its a just a simple question someone needs to ask or an unexpected thing that needs to be added
to the already burgeoning mental list. At times the interruption comes in the form of a slow moving car, road
blocks, or unexpected visitors. Depending upon the way you look at them, interruptions can be set-backs or
set-ups.
My mind goes back to various ones throughout the Bible whose ordinary lives were interrupted by the divine.

```
Marys marriage was interrupted by an unplanned pregnancy that led to her birthing out the
Savior of the world.
```

```
Rebekahs daily task of fetching water was interrupted by a servant on a mission. Which led
to her being married.
```

```
Zacharias service in the temple was interrupted by the appearance of angel bringing good
news.
```

```
Sauls reign of terror was interrupted on the road to Damascus.
```

```
The woman at the well search for water was interrupted by the living water Himself.
```

Each of them no doubt had their own agenda that day. Perhaps expecting only to do what they always did
but in the midst of their ordinary plans a life altering interruption occurred. At times the cleverly robed
interruption is not really a nuisance but an invitation to a life beyond the confines of your own imagination.

Hi Wanda! What a beautiful, though-provoking post for us today. When we look at the ’interruptions’ you bring us
from the Bible, they don’t appear all that unpleasant at all, do they? I hope this will help me pause to seek God in
all of the interruptions of my day, to ask what He has in them for me!
God’s blessings to you today!!

**J is for Juice (2011-04-13 00:04)**

Nothing quite like cup of OJ in the morning. And for me there is only one particular brand of juice I
purchase. Despite its cost Im willing to pay extra because it suits my taste. But sometimes its inevitable

the juice runs out.[1]

Just as the OJ runs out so does my creative juices at times. How do you keep your juices flowing?

Hehe - LOVE it.
Switching to another project helps sometimes. I’ve also found that a change of ”medium” will often get the juices
flowing. Switching to longhand, for instance. Ive even occasionally ”said” what I was wanting to write.
Great question!

**The Danger of Knowledge (2011-04-13 11:24)**

1 Corinthians 8:1b Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

[1]

No one really likes a know it all. Acquiring knowledge is important but we must be watchful of how we use
it. How are you using what you know? Does it make you feel superior to others or are you sharing it love?

Without the knowledge AND wisdom which comes from above, we are likely to get tripped up on what we think we
know. I was listening to a gentleman on TV explain how smart people end up losing and one of the things he said
was that they get to the point where they know so much that they become impatient with those who may not be as
smart and they withdraw from sharing what they know or engaging in conversation which could lead to an exchange
that helps all who are involved.
May we never get to smart for our own good.

**Left Behind (2011-04-14 05:00)**

Death is not something I think about often. But I do place my hope in an eternal home with my Lord and
Savior. Have you given much thought to what type of legacy you hope to leave behind?
I took a 30 day course(well I started it but didnt actually finish it) on journaling by Joseph Peck and the
quote he gave from Jim Rohn led me to think about legacy in all new way. According to Rohn, you have
three key treasures to leave the next generation:

• your journal-write out the ideas, inspirations, and revelations you have picked up on your life journey
• your library-pass on the books that were instrumental in shaping your life
• your photos- take the time to capture the moments of your life.

Are you incorporating each of these areas as part of your legacy? If you had to pick your top books to leave
behind as a part of your legacy which would you pick?

MTJ (2011-04-14 07:04:16)
Hi Wanda,
_How are you my friend?_ I’m unfamiliar with both Joseph Peck and Jim Rohn, but those are interesting treasures to
leave to the generation that follows.
I suppose my blog is a type of digital journal that chronicles my evolution as a Christian. Through it, I am learning
to peer into the reflection of my life in God’s eyes and see the man I’ve been, the man I am, and the man I am to
become.
I will need to create a list of books which have always called me to read them once more. For the past 16 months, I
have read and studied the scriptures daily. It would be nice to brag and say how much I’ve learned, but the truth is
that I’ve learned how little I really know.
I wish that I had more of a visual record of my life. Photographs were not part of my life growing up and I subsequently
placed little importance on it; _to my regret._
_If you had to pick your top books to leave behind as a part of your legacy which would you pick?_ **This is such a**
**good question Wanda.** It’s one I have difficulty answering because there are so many books which have been
influential in my life. Books by James Baldwin, John A. Williams, Herman Hesse, Ed Cole (_Maximized Manhood_). I
been encouraged by Christian brothers to read Watchman Nee, Norman Grub, Billy Graham (_The Holy Spirit_), and
Gary Smalley & John Trent (_The Language of Love_). These books are now part of my library and I hope to God that
I finish them all so that I may encourage the next generation to read them.
I like this concept of having a legacy.
Blessings and peace.

This may sound silly but the legacy I would leave behind is my own book as it;s mostly about my family and friends
and it would be nice to have them remembered,
But I don’t like to dwell on the subject of death....I know it happens to us all but at my age I don’t like thinking of it.

think.

Chelle (2011-04-14 12:14:41)
One of my life’s mentors was mentored by Jim Rohn. Sweet. I love what he says. Thankfully, the blog serves as a
great journal, we have books overflowing from our shelves, and my family calls me the papparazzi. :)

Angela Felsted (2011-04-14 12:29:17)
What book would I leave behind? That is a really hard question. Maybe my journal. It isn’t nearly as fun to reed as
fiction, but it’s real life.

Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-04-14 13:18:22)
I kinda use my blog as a journal. I know I should do more but?? My legacy??

Ella (2011-04-14 13:59:07)
These are 3 of my favorite things
Thanks Wanda, this was really lovely!
xXx

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-14 16:46:34)
I’ve got journals, my library (including my first, now worn, copies of Far From The Madding Crowd and Jane Eyre)
and more photos than I can count. Very interesting question. All three of those things have to do with what our
words and our vision. After my Aunt a/k/a mom died a few years ago, I realized that she had left me words and a
vision. These were things that could never be taken away.

Karen Walker (2011-04-14 16:47:00)
Oh, that’s a hard question. Little Women would definitely be among them, though.
Karen

Wanda (2011-04-14 23:14:02)
Hi MTJ, our blogs definitely stand as record of our journeys through life. Oh hope to become more intentional about
the things I choose to leave behind.
For sure **Yvonne**your book will leave a reach collection of memories.
**JBR** sure ultimately only God understand our full thoughts but your writings will give future generations insights
about you they may never would have gotten otherwise.
**Chelle** the material I have read of Rohn’s has been very good. I can only imagine the insight gain from one on one
mentorship by him.
**Angela** real life is even better than make believe.
**Kim** it’s something to think about.
Thanks **Ella**!
**Bluebutterfly** what a treasure she left you.
**Karen** narrowing it down would be hard for me as well.

Belbin9 (2011-04-15 03:14:49)
Such an awesome post. I have been thinking about what I’m leaving behind and what everyone in general is leaving
behind and sometimes I don’t like what I see. But these treasures are something I have to try out.
Thank you

Arlee Bird (2011-04-15 04:58:08)
I do think about this and the material things that I leave behind are secondary to the memories of those who knew
me and whatever good will I’ve shown to others.
I should keep a journal but I’ve not for the most part.

**Could Never Really Be True? (2011-04-17 03:12)**

I remember back in elementary school the teachers gave us a tip to help us identify the correct answer when
faced with multiple choices. The rule of thumb was that you can eliminate answers containing [1]never and
always because there were rarely cases that this would be true.
I grew up hearing [2]never say never and I can say that I found myself doing or saying some things I thought
I would never do or say. Heard people say they would [3]never leave, never betray, never stop loving only to
have never arrive so soon. Despite their or my own lack of ability to live up to the never(s) we honestly wish
never to do, there is one that speaks never and His word holds true.
But the LORD’s plans stand firm forever; his intentions can never be shaken. Psalms 33:11 (NLT)
For the LORD loves justice, and he will never [4]abandon the godly. He will keep them safe forever, but the
children of the wicked will perish. Psalm 37:28(NLT)

On point Wanda.
Reminds me of what Paul said in Romans 7:18-21. This passage ministered to me especially in my Teens into mid-
twenties when I most had the I’ll never do this; I’d never do that attitude and then found myself doing and saying
even more things that was not GOD’s will for my life. This passage helped me greatly and still does.
Love you!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-04-18 19:25:42)

who God is in our lives.

**Opportunity Knocks (2011-04-18 05:01)**

Did you wake up this morning? Are you able to read this post? (Guess so huh) With the rising of the day
came a brand new [1]opportunity. Doesnt matter if you are going to the same old job, coming home to the
same family, or being challenged by the same old situation. You have been [2]granted an opportunity. An
opportunity to [3]grow, learn, think or act differently. Who knows if the opportunity will come to you again.
What will you do with it?

I think I’ll follow the teaching of an old faithful: Invest in the human soul. - Mary Bethune
This is a good week to invest in the soul, in our soul and in the souls of others.
This posting brought back to me my Saturday meditations (Luke 16:19-31). We need to LISTEN to the soul cries
```

and help others while we have the OPPORTUNITY:
27-28. ”The rich man said, ’Then let me ask you, Father: Send him to the house of my father where I have five
brothers, so he can tell them the score and warn them so they won’t end up here in this place of torment.’

29. ”Abraham answered, ’They have Moses and the Prophets to tell them the score. Let them listen to them.’
30. ”’I know, Father Abraham,’ he said, ’but they’re not listening. If someone came back to them from the dead, they
would change their ways.’
31. ”Abraham replied, ’If they won’t listen to Moses and the Prophets, they’re not going to be convinced by someone
who rises from the dead.’”

**P is for Proverbs (2011-04-19 18:08)**

Cant believe its taken me this long to come up with a plausible p-letter word for my post. Especially when
the book of Proverbs is by far one of my favorite books in the Bible. I like it because it provides so many
practical truths for our daily lives.

Chapter 1 of Proverbs outlines the purpose in which they were written, the Message describes it as

```
Written down so we’ll know how to live well and right, to understand what life means and
where it’s going; A manual for living, for learning what’s right and just and fair; To teach the
inexperienced the ropes and give our young people a grasp on reality. There’s something here
also for seasoned men and women, still a thing or two for the experienced to learn - Fresh wisdom
to probe and penetrate, the rhymes and reasons of wise men and women. Start with God
```

No matter our age there are some nuggets of truth to be pocketed from Proverbs.

```
Lisa (2011-04-19 18:41:29)
The Word of God is full of wisdom for every area of life, isn’t it? So much wisdom in the book of Proverbs. I like how
the Message puts it.

Belbin9 congrats to you on taking a dive into the Word. I pray that your appetite for His Word would increase the
more.
Salarsen nice to meet a fellow challenger. I look forward to getting to know you.

Amen Wanda!
I am very blessed still and always will be; by the book of Proverbs and the entire Bible. We will never arrive until we
get to glory so until then, I need the Word of God constantly in order to live this Christian journey in a God-honoring
way so I agree with you!
Book of Proverbs holds great wisdom for all of us no matter what stage in our Christian lives.
Blessings and love to you!!

**Questions (2011-04-21 02:57)**

```
[1]questions

```

Kids are some of the most curious creatures around. Their incessant questioning of why or whats that can
become a nuisance after about the 1000th(of course its never really that many times it just seems that way)
time of answering such questions. Because they havent lived long enough to develop inhibitions, they quickly
ask whatever comes to mind. Despite the place or time.

Im not really sure when it happened but some where in the course of my life, I developed hatred for the
word no. Of course later I discovered this is more aptly called a fear of rejection. Thus it left me refusing
to ask some questions. Unasked questions led to unanswered questions. There are a myriad of reasons why
people can not or will not fulfill our requests but there is One who knows all things and stands willing and
ready to hear our requests. God is no magic genie or Santa Claus and He should not be approached as such
but we dont have to be afraid to ask Him even the really though questions.

If you need wisdom – if you want to know what God wants you to do – ask him, and he will gladly tell you.
He will not resent your asking. James 1:5 NLT

You want what you don’t have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous for what others have, and
you can’t possess it, so you fight and quarrel to take it away from them. And yet the reason you don’t have
what you want is that you don’t ask God for it. James 4:2 NLT

**He Already Paid the Price (2011-04-21 17:56)**

Any day is perfect day to reflect upon Gods redemption plan but as we prepare to remember the burial and
resurrection of Christ, it seems even more fitting. [1]Dictionary.com defines [2]redeemed as:

1. to buy or pay off; clear by payment: to redeem a mortgage.
2. to buy back, as after a tax sale or a mortgage foreclosure.
3. to recover (something pledged or mortgaged) by payment or other satisfaction: to redeem a pawned
watch.
4. to exchange (bonds, trading stamps, etc.) for money or goods.
5. to convert (paper money) into specie.
6. to discharge or fulfill (a pledge, promise, etc.).
7. to make up for; make amends for; offset (some fault,shortcoming, etc.
8. to obtain the release or restoration of, as from captivity, by paying a ransom.
9. Theology. to deliver from sin and its consequences by means of a sacrifice offered for the sinner.

The debt that I owe is too great for me ever to repay. Through the shedding of Christs blood and subsequent
[3]resurrection, he released me from the chains my sins bought me.

But the LORD will redeem those who serve him. Everyone who trusts in him will be freely pardoned. Psalms
34:22 (NLT)

Yet they cannot redeem themselves from death by paying a ransom to God. Psalms 49:7

hi Wanda:)
a few weeks ago i was listening to a podcast(sermon) concerning Jesus our Redeemer. it’s a word i didn’t really
understand and i hadn’t given it much thought, really. it had gotten glossed over. there’s SO MUCH to His Word
that i know i will never know the depth or the richness of His Word until someday....:)
think i will listen to that sermon again. thank you for the reminder!

Sun scorched, battered, and bruised
scorned, spit upon, and despised
one single man to bear the sins for us all
disciples confused and scattered
only heaven knew the full conclusion of the matter
tucked away beneath the earth
death proclaiming an triumphant end to his reign
yet the dress of death and doom could not hold its grip
for in three days time He arose silencing the victorious claims of his assailants
showing that His reign knows no end
[3]He rose that day that I may live again
Wishing you a blessed Easter celebration!

**Thankful for Today (2011-04-23 13:59)**

[1]Thankful for today because [2]tomorrow is never promised to any of us.

Thankful for today because I survived yesterday.

Thankful for today because through His grace I am able to stand even after it all.

All of what you may wonder. After all the disappointment, the hurt, the pain, the shame, the tears, and the
sadness Im still here.

Still here looking unto you. Thank you for keeping me when I was sure it was the end.
Thank you for protecting me when I didnt have a clue how close danger really was.

Thank you for ears that are able to hear the melodious morning song of nature.

Thank for a sense of touch that can feel the whispering wind so gently graze my face.

Thank you for eyes which can behold the beauty of your creation.

And, thanks to each of you who continue to stop by The Watered Soul. Each of your visits are a refreshing
drink. My prayer is that just as you have refreshed me that others may come along and be a refreshing for
you. Have a wonderful weekend.

The generous soul will be made rich, And he who waters will also be watered himself. Proverbs 11:25 NKJV

**Unless (2011-04-25 11:59)**

Confession is good for the soul isnt it? Well I have a bit of confession today. I have always been the shy,
introverted type. And because of that I lived a life full of conditions.

I wouldnt eat inside a restaurant unless someone else was with me.

I wouldnt speak unless spoken to first.

I wouldnt ask unless I was pretty sure the answer would be yes.

I wouldnt go unless someone I knew would be there.

So many unless(s) left me with less that what life had to offer.

Are you living a life full of unconscious and unspoken unless(s) that has kept you in a limited place?

Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the
watchmen stand guard in vain. Psalms 127:1

```
welcome to my world of poetry (2011-04-25 13:25:10)

Wanda, this is a very thought provoking post for reflection. It’s very true that many of us hold back consciously and

I need to believe in me more without putting those kind of conditions on it. Thanks so much for this post!

very good post.

Lorena G. Sims (2011-04-25 23:23:52)
I didn’t really thought of that until I read your post. I can totally relate.

Pam (2011-04-25 23:28:26)
Looks like there are quite a few of us who are on a first name basis with ”unless”, Wanda. Thanks for the spiritual
perspective on how limiting this can be.

Wanda (2011-04-26 01:51:03)
Glad to see I’m not alone. This post didn’t go in the direction ”I” had originally intended but Father knows best. It
was one of those kind I immediately wanted to retrieve after hitting the publish button.

Karen (2011-04-26 01:51:20)
Simply profound lesson on this...I share many of these unless(s) with you...thanks for making me realize what this
does....

Ella (2011-04-26 02:55:09)
Wow, this stimulates a lot of memories n’ thoughts. I always hesitated, felt inadequate. It is a difficult road. I think
a lot of us, just get tired of the same turn of events and then we start to change.
It takes time and experience to come to this I can relate! Great post

Empty Nest Insider (2011-04-26 02:57:31)
Thanks for visiting me! I could relate to some of your ’unless’ moments. That’s why the A-Z Challenge is so great,

more of you! Julie

Christy LaShea (2011-04-26 10:05:54)
Wanda, I’m like you, I won’t eat inside a restaurant unless someone is with me. Your post made me think that when

Hi Wanda -
How interesting about you. Are you still inclined in those areas?
It is obvious to me that you have a sweet spirit that leans, in earnest, to the things of GOD. Also, it is clear that you
love Him.
That scripture spoke volumes.
Thank you, Wanda.

**Value in the Valley (2011-04-26 17:37)**

Several years ago I read a book by Iyanla Vanzant entitled The Value in the Valley. Couldnt put my hands
on the book today but as I thought about todays letter V valley was one of the words that stuck out in my
mind.

We all have had experiences of walking along various valleys in our life. Some times our stay in the valley
extends much longer than we would naturally volunteer to abide. But even the low, depressed places of life
have significant value. However, I am not always able to see that at first glance but when I change my view
and remember that I am always in Gods omniscient view.

Some of the most profound, life-changing revelations I received have been in the midst of the dark valley. It
was in the valley that I caught new glimpses of God.

Even when I walk through the dark valley of death, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your
rod and your staff protect and comfort me. Psalms 23:4 NLT

Sharon Kirby (2011-04-26 18:51:45)
I have to agree, Wanda. Valleys are not fun. But I have also caught some of the sweetest glimpses of God in the midst
of walking through them. I think that the Light shines brightest when the darkness is deep.
Hope you had a wonderful Easter, and thank you for sharing this very encouraging post.
GOD BLESS!

Amen...I really need to remember this the next time I feel the need to spout off...Lord, help me!

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2011-04-28 02:05:17)
I think there’s a Scripture that says ”even a fool is thought wise if he keeps his mouth shut.” Too many words come
sliding out of my mouth at times.
Thanks for the reminder.
Janis

Joan (2011-04-28 02:31:56)
There is a reason God gave us two ears and only one mouth. Unfortunately, I’m often guilty of doing too much talking
and not enough listening.
Great word for today.

I’m a quiet person, my husband doesn’t like it though:) i just don’t like arguments:)
If I don’t have something good to say, I’ve rather shut up.

**Xed Out (2011-04-29 00:29)**

Thinking about the letter x brings to mind those dreaded red marks teachers would place all over your papers
to signify you answered the question wrong. Being the studious type, I aimed for As so those x-mark were
never a welcomed sight. And why did they need to make them in red? As if the big x wasnt enough.
With the end of my formal education, the xs didnt stop following me. Why? Because I was still getting
things wrong. Saying the wrong things, doing the wrong things, and saying the wrong things. Yep I did
them and still find myself in the wrong. Of course there is no teacher following me around marking my paper
but God sees all and knows all. All of the wrongs. Nothing hidden from Him even when others cant see.

But over 2000 years ago He sent a remedy to x-out my sins. And wouldnt you know it that the only thing
strong enough to cross out my sins and yours was the red shed blood of Jesus Christ.

Joanne Sher (2011-04-29 01:06:12)
Great thoughts, Wanda. When I used to correct papers in my ”former life” as a teacher, I actually enjoyed using
purple. But the red blood is the only thing that really crosses them out, isn’t it?

```
Lisa (2011-04-29 01:37:41)
Amen! Thank you for the cross, Lord!
```

```
Ella (2011-04-29 02:38:11)
Well said! Love that cross out our sins
```

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-04-29 08:04:37)

Missie (2011-04-29 12:48:25)
I get so down on myself because of lots of old xs...and forget to remember that my xs were erased. Grace is so hard
to believe sometimes, so we keep ourselves in these chains instead of letting ourselves free of the xs.
great post!
```

```
Lucy Adams (2011-04-29 13:45:01)
I was sensitive to those red Xs, too, in school.
Lucy
```

```
Donna Weaver (2011-04-29 18:47:22)
And life’s all about learning. Those Xs, as tough as they are, teach us. We learn some of our greatest life lessons from
the mistakes we make. Not that I’m into making mistakes just for the sake of the learning though. =D
```

```
And yay for redemption and the one who made it possible.

Sharon - Grandma is a Writer (2011-04-29 19:34:56)
This is an awesome comparison and one I have never thought about. So thankful that He did that for me. You really
expressed this concept well.
```

```
Sharon (2011-04-30 01:11:10)
Wonderful, Wanda!
Yes, I know exactly what you’re talking about! Those X’s were always HUGE - sometimes it felt like they really
represented ”loser.”
But no - on a cross, my sins got x-ed out! Now, I’m proud to be a ”loser” - for if I lose my life for Christ, I will find it!
GOD BLESS!

Judy (2011-04-30 01:57:18)

**Still Say Yes (2011-04-30 03:04)**

After all the heartache and tears

After all the time waiting

After all the misunderstandings

After all the disappointments

After all the ups and downs

Even through the smiles and frowns

My answer remains the same

I still say YES to you Lord!

For no matter how many promises God has made, they are ”Yes” in Christ. And so through him the ”Amen”
is spoken by us to the glory of God. 2 Corinthians 1:20 NIV

```
Lisa (2011-04-30 03:14:23)
Amen! I still say yes too.
```

```

A yes to Him is the best answer we could ever give. Isn’t it? Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Blessings

**Z is for Zip (2011-04-30 14:37)**

The month of April and the A-Z challenge is zipping to a close. It has been quite a challenge indeed. And

time to visit each of you. Congratulations to each of you on a job well done. Hope you enjoy some refreshing
ZZZs this weekend.

Judy (2011-04-30 20:43:21)
Hi Wanda,
I have a Nikon D5000 DSLR. It came with what’s called a kit lens (18-55mm). I bought the two-lens kit, which also
came with a 55-200 mm telephoto lens for zooming in on subjects far away. It’s a must have.
I traded in the 55-200 mm for the 55-300 mm some months ago. If you want to see all of my camera gear, click on
Camera Gear at the top of my blog to the right. There, you’ll see photos and a list of what I have.
Blessings,
Judy

**Promises to Keep (2011-05-09 07:39)**

Who hasnt made a promise that they intended to keep?

[1] In Ann Tatlocks Promises to Keep there are plenty promises made. A
mother promises to protect her children, an old lady promises to die in the home she and her husband built,
an abusive father promises to get his family back, two girls promise to pray until they are reunited with their
fathers. The problem is each of these promises collide with the promises made by another. Through the eyes
of 11 year old Roz, readers are taken along a winding road of naÔve trust, laughter, loss, love, and reclaimed
faith.

Fresh on the hills of striving to start a new life after escaping her abusive marriage, Janis Anthony finds
herself dealing with an unexpected and repeated visitor, Tillie Monroe, who has come to reclaim her home
and fulfill her last promise. Tillie, an old folks home escapee, persistence and presence turns out to be a
disguised blessing for Janis and her three children. By far, my favorite character was Tillie with her quick
wit.

As a first time reader of Ms. Tatlocks work, I was pleasantly pleased by her characters and writing style and
look forward to reading more of her books. According to the author, God as father and discernment are the
two central themes. She points out, Not everything we think we want in this life is Gods best for us. Some
dreams only weigh us down; its when we let go of those dreams that we begin to soar. We need to be wise
and discerning, trusting God the Father to fill our lives with all that He has deemed good and beneficial.

I was provided a complimentary copy of the book from [2]Bethany House Publisher in exchange for an
unbiased review.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-05-09 16:44:56)
Wanda, thanks for the review. I’ve certainly being at that ”when we let go” junction several times in my life, and I
have found that it is much better to just let go.
```

```
Wanda (2011-05-10 12:02:51)
Thanks, I sure enjoyed reading the book. It was released in Feb so it should be available in bookstores or at Amazon.

Thanks Wanda for sharing; sounds like a lot of subjects. Wow, dreams weighing us down...think that is me and the
Culinary dream. xXx

Sharon (2011-05-11 23:50:56)
Great review - and such truth. Yes, letting go of our dreams to the Lord, knowing that His Wisdom is the only true
freedom - that’s what I want to do.
GOD BLESS!

**Got Ta Get Ma Groove Back (2011-05-16 06:40)**

Whew, I cant believe a whole week has past without me writing here. The hiatus was unplanned but needed.
Had a bustling week of business activities last week and on a personal level I was battling a bit of the blues.
But Im BACK. Well Im slowly trying to get my bloggy groove back. I have missed you all and Im looking
forward to catching up with you in blogland real soon. Blessings to you.

```
Joanne Sher (2011-05-16 06:51:05)
Definitely missed you - praying for ya - and glad you’re back!
```

```
Pam (2011-05-16 07:06:00)
Missed you and your nuggets of truth about Jesus, Wanda. So glad you are back.

Welcome back! You were missed!

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-05-16 16:38:31)
Having God in our lives is like being in the Conga, you can take a break and get right back in without missing a beat.
Sometimes a girl’s got to sit on the sidelines and tap her toes to the beat...you’re still in rhythm, even if out of sight.
```

```
wisdomvirtueandrubies (2011-05-16 17:09:00)
Although I’m sure we’ve all missed you, too, I realize that very often an unplanned hiatus is the best kind. I’m sure
you’ll be back in the swing of things very soon!

Karen (2011-05-16 19:06:04)

**Mission Complete? (2011-05-17 11:12)**

There is nothing quite like the feeling of seeing ones task complete. However, as I read passages of scripture
from I Samuel chapter 15, I found myself wondering how many times have I, have you, have we called a
mission complete prematurely.
Saul was given specific instructions on how to complete his God-given mission.

```
Now go and completely destroy the entire Amalekite nation-men, women, children, babies,
cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys. I Samuel 15:3
```

And he got busy doing the assignment.

```
vs. 4a So Saul mobilized his army at Telaim. vs 7-9 Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites
from Havilah all the way to Shur,east of Egypt. He captured Agag, the Amalekite king, but
completely destroyed everyone else. Saul and his men spared Agags life and kept the best of the
sheep and goats, the cattle, the fat claves, and the lambs-everything, in fact, that appealed to
them. They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality.
```

Saul and the people were pleased with his work but God was not.

```
vs. 20 But I did obey the Lord, Saul insisted. I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought
back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else. Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep,
goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.
```

Could there be some places in our lives that we self-righteously assume we have completed the assignment
God gave us but if we stop to examine the original instructions, we would find that we veered off course?
It doesnt matter how many people are singing our praise because we look successful on the outside. If we
fail to obey God, we run the same risk of displacement like Saul.
Lord forgive me for all the times I assume my way of doing things was better. Or I gave into fear and simply
didnt make even the first step toward completing the assignment you had given unto me. Lord give me a
willing and obedient spirit. Not just willing to do your work but willing to do it your way Lord. In Jesus
name, Amen.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-05-17 12:45:25)
Oh, Wanda, you have hit on something today. Many people are waiting like the kid who’s turned in homework that
was not done exactly as the teacher had instruced, expecting some sort of reward or recognition, and are angry when
the teacher hands us back the paper with an ”F”. Sometimes the teacher extends the deadline, but sometimes the ”F”
is the final grade. It is much better to pay attention during every step of the assignment, follow instructions exactly
as given and don’t quit until our task is complete. It is better to obey early and completely.

Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-05-17 13:26:52)
You said it right, we do assume that we have it right! I need help with that also!

Joanne Sher (2011-05-17 14:10:50)
Oh, absolutely! We don’t listen carefully to Him, do we? We think we’re done, and we’re not. And he’s displeased.
Great reminder, Wanda!

Shanda (2011-05-17 16:03:14)
I have thought about this often and even spoke to a women’s group about the subject; including the reasons why we
stop too early. Never used those Scriptures tough. Great passage to back up the thought.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-05-17 16:07:30)
I have not got it right at all,
somewhere along the line I have failed my son, who don’t want me in his life anymore and am being deprived of my
three grandchildren.
I have prayed for guidance, thought through my last conversation we had and I can’t fathom where I have failed.
Yvonne.

Missie (2011-05-17 16:53:43)
how, so true...I don’t know how many times I have given one part to God, but not the whole thing. Thank you for
sharing these verses

Lisa (2011-05-17 20:52:32)
How true! We must be careful to do what God says completely. I don’t want to try to justify my actions like Saul
did. I want to obey - period.

Tours In Venice (2011-05-17 22:29:36)
I try to be an all or nothing type of person, but I too, get distracted. I think it’s in human nature to get somewhat
distracted and in it for ourselves from time to time. However, with enough self control and preservation, I feel that
we’ll be reminded to do the right thing and all of it in His name in the end.
Sara

Sharon (2011-05-18 00:51:13)
Great lesson, Wanda - one that I’m really taking to heart. And, I so appreciated your prayer - I prayed it as my own,
because it so echoed my feelings.
By the way, really sounds like you’re getting your groove back! :)
GOD BLESS!

Wanda (2011-05-18 01:59:52)
Bluebutterfly, you captured my thought about sometimes disobeying leads to a permanent loss. There are some times
when we don’t get the opportunity for a do-over.
Me too Kim :)

```
Joanne, I think there are times that we really think we have done it right but it doesn’t what we or others think.
Does it?
Shanda, great mind think a like. What passages did you use in your talk?
Yvonne, none of us are perfect and despite what you son may feel that you have done wrong (rather it’s real or imag-
ined) I can assure you that you done a bunch of good too. I pray that your relationship will be able to be restored.
Missie & Lisa, oh me too.
Sara, yes the reminds come in many forms but of course its best to pay attention the first time.
Lol, Sharon, I’m trying to find it again.
```

```
Susan (2011-05-18 05:47:12)
Thanks for stopping by my blog. I enjoyed this - what we often forget is when we fail to complete the task God has
for us, others losse out too - not just us. Thank you for your insight into this scripture!

Susan, excellent point. It’s not just about us.
Jackie, I think we all have been guilty of it at some point.

**The Night is Coming (2011-05-18 06:33)**

[1]

We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent us. The night is coming, and then no

one can work. John 9:4 (NLT)

We all know that we will not be here (not on this side of heaven anyway) forever despite the lyrics in Fame.
But who knows the number of our days? Whatever the number, we only have a certain window of time to
complete the work He has given us.

Are you using the time wisely? Night is coming you know.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-05-18 16:43:28)
Wanda, Wanda, Wanda ..... Oh yes. Earlier today, I listened to NPR as a theologian stated that one of the reasons
so many false doctrines and extremes within Christianity are drawing people away from the Body of Christ is that
the average mainstream church no longer teaches the word, especially the second coming of Christ. May we all walk
in light and take every opportunity to live in light and be aware of the time and the season. Night is coming.

it is upon us and we DO need to carry out the tasks that Jesus gave us. Beautiful reminder and Word!

Hi there dear Wanda,
What a TIMELY word! I’ve been engrossed, once again, in the Dream Giver as I teach it at Bible Study at church
and that has been the running theme I’ve been encouraging them as the Holy Spirit encourages me; that we must get
busy working and completing what GOD has purposed us to do.
Your message is a blessed reminder and confirmation to my spirit. Love the photo you selected.
I pray that you are doing well Wanda. You are a blessing to ALL of us!
Much love,
Lisa

Ella (2011-05-20 21:39:48)

best with our time

Sharon (2011-05-21 16:38:04)
Convicting and inspiring, Wanda.
Yes, I am doing my best to be about the Lord’s work. Night is coming...
...and He is coming, the Light of the World.
GOD BLESS!

Wanda (2011-05-21 19:42:58)

Hi Wanda,
Amen! I’d like to think I’m using my time wisely. Writing for the Lord and living for him. In light of the false
prediction of judgment day this past weekend and all of the natural disasters lately, our time on this earth as we know
it is short. Judgment day may not have occurred Saturday, but it is truly coming soon! I wrote about this in my
latest blog posts. Enjoy!

**He Makes it Possible (2011-05-26 02:52)**

Give me an eagerness for your laws rather than a love for money!

Turn my eyes from worthless things and give me life through your word.

Help me abandon my shameful ways; for your regulations are good.

Psalms 119: 36-37, 39 (NLT)

Do you ever have those times that you want to do better but it seems your actions just dont line up with
your hearts desire? Reading this passage, reminded me that I can take my shortcomings to God. For it is
Him that gives the desire and the ability to do His will.

```
Joanne Sher (2011-05-26 13:38:45)
Amen. SO glad He is there for us. Thanks for this wonderful reminder, Wanda!

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-05-26 17:24:34)
Thank you, Wanda, for covering a verse from Psalm 119 today. I study through Psalm 119 at least twice each year

Thank you, also, for commenting on my blog. For some reason I am unable to make a comment on my own blog.
Blessings to you, I plan to recruit you into Starbucks land soon.

Dawn M. Hamsher (2011-05-28 02:27:59)

I totally get this one. And yes, it’s hard when my actions don’t line up with my desires. It’s even harder when I not
only want to DO better, I want to BE better. But, for both things, God is the answer.
Philippians 2:13 (NLT): ”For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.”
GOD BLESS!

**The Choice Wasn****t Mine (2011-05-28 05:01)**

[1] I have made a lot of choices in my life.

I chose the car I drive.

I chose the home I live in.

I chose the college I attended.

I choose the clothes I wear.

I choose the food I eat.

I choose the television program I watch.

Many, many choices to be made during the course of day and even more during the course of a lifetime but
there is one choice I didnt make.

I didnt choose Jesus. Yep, you heard right. The most important choice one can make in life and I didnt
really make the decision.

Nope something far greater happened, Jesus chose me. Yes, me&Wanda.

John 15:16 (NLT) You didnt choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so
that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.

**Pondering the Path (2011-05-30 14:10)**

What trodden [1]track are you trekking upon at this time in your life? What course of action or conduct is
governing those [2]steps of yours?

Like I have expressed many times here, I am what I c[3] all [4]directionally
challenged. As you can imagine, this handicap has left me headed in the wrong direction, lost, confused,
frustrated and frantically trying to navigate myself back onto the right road many times. On one such
occasion, my nephew asked why do we ALWAYS get lost whenever we go some where. Any sane adult knows
that when you are in the middle of a lost episode is not the time one welcomes the opportunity to ponder
the question of why am I always getting lost. Oh no, instead I want to know how to find my way out of it.
But if one only asks the how to get out of here question instead of the why am I here question, they find
themselves repeatedly in similar situations. Am I here because I have been trying to be in the drivers seat
of my own life? Proverbs 14:12(NLT) says there is a path before each person that seems right to a man, but
in the end it leads to death.
Yet when I allow God to be my GPS He directs my lifes turns. And even though the roads He takes me
down often look different from those I would like to take, I can be assured that He is leading me along a path
that leads to life. But not just a life of existence but one of liveliness filled full of Him and all that He is.
You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at
your right hand. Psalm 16:11

Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-05-30 15:07:24)
I agree, this is rich thoughts here. We need the direction!

Shanda (2011-05-30 19:19:27)
Great analogy of letting God be our GPS. It is so true. Often taking my own path is what gets me over committed
and going in a wrong direction.

Missie (2011-05-30 22:41:16)
Amen! Great post!

Sharon (2011-05-31 00:24:32)
Good stuff, Wanda!
I’m asking the Lord for clear direction in my life. But, most of all, I’m just asking Him to teach me more about
Himself. I just want to see Him, no matter where I am or where I’m going.
He is the Lamp to my feet and the Light on my path...
GOD BLESS!

Anna K(arlene) Jeffrey (2011-05-31 02:59:23)
I love that reference to the GPS and its connection to the Scripture. SO fitting! I often find myself right where you’ve
described.
One time, I was lost in territory I knew nothing about. There was only road, forest, and more forest to mark my
way. If it weren’t for someone with great navigational skills, I’d have been driving frightened and frustrated for much
longer than necessary. Thank you for the reminder to rely on God for directions. :)

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-05-31 03:09:25)
My GPS for life! I just need to make sure I check that GPS before I my daily journey! Loved the post!

Hi Wanda -
Thank you for this rich message.
Especially I love this that you expressed, ”... filled full of Him and all that He is.”

God as our GPS - Love it Wanda.
Thanks for the reminder.
It was nice to see that you popped into The Faith Lounge for refreshment - thanks for the comment.
God Bless.

I love the GPS guidance and this post
I have missed a lot; I will be back to catch up! xXx

Anna (2011-06-01 14:13:37)
Wanda,
What a great metaphor for the way God seeks to direct our paths. I do wonder though whether we have a tendency
to decide that the left we want to talk is what God wants for us. How do you think we should go about ensuring
that we’re not deciding that our way is God’s way, rather than seeking his will and his guidance from his word and
applying the principles we learn there with the guidance of his spirit?

Blessings.
PS: Your blog layout and design are lovely! Very easy on the eye.

**He Keeps Watch (2011-06-06 14:57)**

Gods faithfulness continues to amaze me. This weekend the unexpected happened-a medical emergency that
could have resulted in my older sisters death BUT God! He keeps us from dangers that we dont even know
exist.

```
A song for the ascent to Jerusalem. I look up to the mountains – does my help come from
there? My help comes from the LORD, who made the heavens and the earth! He will not let you
stumble and fall; the one who watches over you will not sleep. Indeed, he who watches over Israel
never tires and never sleeps. The LORD himself watches over you! The LORD stands beside you
as your protective shade. The sun will not hurt you by day, nor the moon at night. The LORD
keeps you from all evil and preserves your life. The LORD keeps watch over you as you come
and go, both now and forever. Psalms 121 (NLT)
```

Would you agree in prayer with me that she has a full recovery with no adverse reactions from any treatment?

```
Karen (2011-06-06 15:13:46)
Standing in agreement and lifting up prayers!

I stand in agreement and prayer, with you, Wanda, awaiting the blessed news that God has moved mightily again, in
this situation, as He sends His Word and heals.
Blessings to you.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-06-07 16:28:43)
Lord, You are good, and Your mercies endure forever. We thank You for Your amazing grace. We thank You for your
strength. We thank You for Spirit life. Strengthen Wanda (in mind, body and Spirit), Lord, so that she will be able
to stand in the gap.
Lord, we believe. Lord, we receive. Be it unto this family according to Your word. Even when we are weak, and even
when our faith fails, You are strong, and You are are faithful. You will never deny who you are. Your word is fixed.
Our faith may fail, His never wanes- That’s who He is, He cannot change! - 2 Timothy 2:13

Kaye Swain - SandwichINK for the Sandwich Generation (2011-06-08 15:29:20)
Very encouraging promises of God in the Bible! And WOW! PRAISE GOD for protecting your sister! And praying
with you for complete healing!

**Got You Covered (2011-06-08 06:20)**

[1]

I have never been to Jerusalem but I have seen mountains. They are massive and I pale in comparison to
them. Same way with my God. He is bigger than me, can see farther than me, and He sits higher than me.

I like The Message translation as well

Mountains encircle Jerusalem,
and God encircles his people
always has and always will.

Happy Word-filled Wednesday!

And thanks so much for your prayers for my sister, she is doing better but still in the hospital.

**Monday Manna**&**1 John 5:4 (2011-06-13 12:33)**

Sharing my thoughts on this weeks Monday Manna verse over at [1]An Open Book.

```
Everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world,
even our faith. 1 John 5:4 (NIV)
```

As I read this verse today, the word overcomes leapt out at me. For me to OVER come anything, it first
must COME. Yep, even all the stuff I would rather stick my head in the sand and avoid, it MUST come.

Essentially this verse says to me that yes

heartache did COME

trouble does COME

trials do COME

struggles COME

but I get OVER them not because Im so smart but only because of faith in Him. It is Him that gives us
the VICTORY OVER the things that COME into our lives.

For every child of God defeats this evil world by trusting Christ to give the victory. (NLT)

No matter what is come into your life at this time know that victory has already been declared for you.

**When Loving You is Wrong (2011-06-16 08:01)**

```

```

I remember the lyrics of song that said if loving you is wrong, I dont want to be right. Kind of sounds like a
song a hopeless (or should a say reckless) romantic might sing. I have had my own encounter of loving when
it was wrong. And wouldnt you know I found myself in the Word of God as I read I Kings 11. My sneaky
suspicion was confirmed that I was not the only one to find themselves on the wrong side of love.
Solomon-the wisest person in the world and a king no doubt-found himself in a precarious position. He had
a thing for foreign women. Even after receiving clear instructions to avoid them.

```
The LORD had clearly instructed his people not to intermarry with those nations, because
the women they married would lead them to worship their gods. I Kings 11:2a
```

Solomon was a man well versed in Gods Word and man full of wisdom.

```
Yet Solomon insisted on loving them anyway. I Kings 11:2b
```

I guess he wasnt willing to give them up so he could be right. Some how he consider them worth the cost
of being wrong.
Stay tuned as I explore the cost he paid for loving when its wrong.

Hi Wanda -
For sure, you parked on my street with this post. More than once, I loved wrong. Praise be to our Lord that now I
love right - GOD first.
May He help us all to steadfastly do that. Everything AND everyone must be AFTER GOD!
Thank you, Wanda, for this post.
Note: Yes, I remember that song. Yesterday, our Lord put Marvin Gaye’s and James Brown’s music on my mind.
Back in the day, they were two of my favorites.

Connie Arnold (2011-06-21 21:05:07)
Interesting post, Wanda. No matter how wise a person is, temptation is there and often hard to resist. Sometimes
love can truly make you blind to what is right.

```
Wanda (2011-06-22 02:27:48)
Appreciate each of you chiming in on this topic. I think many of us have had the experience of being on the wrong
side of love. Hope to pick up with this topic soon; I have been a bit frazzled lately. Blessings to each of you.

Dawn M. Hamsher (2011-06-29 00:36:19)

Been there. Thank goodness I learned from my mistake. Second time around I let God choose my husband.
Now, I talk to my 11 year old about what to look for in a future husband (it is never too early) and that she needs
ask for God’s guidance. I hope she learns from my 1st mistake.
```

**Where Art Thou? (2011-06-22 00:43)**

Where ever you are God sees it but do you?
He is not intimated by your location-whether it be a physical, mental, or spiritual place.
All He wants from you is you to realize where you are. He extends the same questions to each individual as
he did to Adam in the garden.
Where art thou?
What is your real location? Not the one you that you would have everyone else to believe you are but rather
the place where you retreat to in the solace of your mind.
Where are thou?
God doesnt ask us to get ourselves from the place but only acknowledge that we are there.
Here is where I am.
I am distracted.
I am frustrated at times.
I am afraid at times.
I am confused.
I am scattered.
I am lonely.
I am tired.
I am disappointed.
I am questioning.
I am thinking of quitting.
I am considering giving up.
I am seeking for direction.
Yep I AM all of that. Nope I didnt throw any of those good things but rather exposing the inner struggles
of where I am currently. Why do I dare pull the cover backonly because God requests that I do.

During my time of prayer, praise and worship to Him, He reminded me that where ever I am, I can admit
that to Him even when I cant articulate it to others.
And when I admit where I am is when I AM reveals Himself to me in other faucets.

When I am confused, the I AM is my SHEPHERD.

When I am tired, the I AM is my STRENGTH.

When I am disappointed, the I AM is my HOPE.

When I am distracted, I AM restores my SIGHT.

When I am lonely, I AM is my COMFORT.

When I am lost, I AM is my WAY.

When I am thinking of quitting, I AM UPHOLDS me.

Lord I thank you that you are the great I AM. Your greatness super exceeds any of my past, present, or
future I am (s). Thank you for renewed strength and power today. Father I lift up my sisters and brothers
and pray that wherever they are that your glory would be revealed to them in that very place. In Jesus
name, Amen.

Wanda, this has to be one of my all-time favorite posts of yours. It was so good. I loved how you contrasted all the
”I am” phrases that describe how we often feel, with the great and eternal I AM. That was powerful.
Thanks so much for sharing this - I have been encouraged tonight.
GOD BLESS!

God just wants us to be authentic so that we do not hide behind layers. We can’t hide anything from God anyway.
When he calls out to Adam, it is for Adam to tell the truth. We need to be honest with God...tell Him what you are
going through.

Hi Wanda -
I am feeling you on this, lady.
You wrote this with such openness.
I so appreciated that you expressed these rich truths.
And I love what you did with I AM in this piece. No matter where we are and what circumstances occur, GOD is
present and a very present help.

I am selfish.
I am thankful for a God who loves me no matter what. One that lifts me up and I don’t deserve it. One who cheers
me on even when I am not focused on him.
Wanda, Thank you for your ministry. Your words help me get my focus back on God.

**Strength for Today (2011-06-29 17:50)**

There are days that I feel feel tattered and worn like this old door. But as I stumbled across verse 25 of
Deuteronomy 33, I was encouraged and invigorated knowing that God gives me strength equal to the days
challenges.

Yes, Wanda. He gives us all that we need for today. I was reminded of this last night when a friend who is in the

reason and God will enable Him to do all that he is called to do until he is called to his eternal rest.

## 2.7 July

**Random Musing (2011-07-12 00:43)**

Seems like forever since I have written anything of note. Lots of things cross my mind yet my fingers can
not seem to find their smooth rhythmic pattern these days. However, its probably at those times that

writing would prove to be most therapeutic. It seems my mind is divided in a thousand little pieces that
lack congruency.

Am I slowly resolving to my own little plan B or am I really prepared to stay the course until my personal
GPS, the Holy Spirit, directs me to my next turn? At times the silence between the designated turn points
is deafening. Its then that I question like my six-year old niece, has the man stop talking. Intellectually, I
know that its only necessary for the GPS to speak when its time to make some change in course. But, it
doesnt stop me from longing to hear His voice in the in between spaces of life.

```

Thanks ladies for your thoughts and prayers you have shared. At times I wonder does my writings matter much
with so many blogs around. I have discovered others who seem to be experience a bit of writing drought these days.
Perhaps cooler weather will help ;)
```

**But What About the Brook (2011-07-14 08:00)**

Amongst all the disarrayed thoughts, the account of Elijah at the brook of Cherith has been lodged in my
mind for several days now. Some how I keep having reoccurring encounters with this story. My sister brings
it up during a conversation and then my devotional book just happens to have a passage of scripture from
this particular event in the Bible. Seems as if someone has been flashing a neon light at me that I need not
flippantly pass by.

```
After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land. And the word of the
Lord came to him: I kings 17:7-8 (AMP)
```

While I have heard of Elijahs experience at the brook before, I had never considered how he must have felt
as he sat and watch the brook come to a dry dust bowl. In my mind, I imagine him wondering how exactly
did he get here. After all, he was following Gods command. But after a while that place no longer provided
provision. I wonder if he might have become antsy and was tempted to get moving elsewhere when in noticed
the continually dwindle water supply. Had he possible cooked up his own plan B? Did he wonder if he had
some how missed God on this one?
To remain steadfast beside the brook until it dried up displayed Elijahs trust in Gods ability and willingness
to provide for his needs. To stay when tempted to run out and do our own thing reveals our refusal to be
lead by our own understanding.
One thing I noticed was that Elijah only received his next instruction after the brook dried up. Which brings
to mind how Im often trying to figure out the next steps along the path rather than just trusting that the
Master will direct my footsteps.

Heres an excerpt from Streams in the Desert:

```
Most of us would have become anxious and tired, and would have made other plans long
before God spoke. Our singing would have stopped as soon as the stream flowed less musically
over its rocky bed. We would have hung our harps on the willows nearby and begun pacing back
and forth on the withering grass, worrying about our predicament. And probably, long before
the brook actually dried up, we would have devised some plan, asked God to bless it, and headed
elsewhere.
```

Have you found yourself sitting along you own brook of Cherith recently? Did you step out into something
in which you felt was spirit-inspired only to see it dwindle away? Were you able to sit patiently as it dried
up or did you find yourself gravitating to cooking up your own options?

```
My daily walk in His grace! (2011-07-14 11:56:40)
Hi Wanda - This is so true. We’ve been waiting on the Lord for something and we believe He is going to come through
for us, but as time has gone by and we have felt pressure, we start thinking, did we hear right? Is there a plan b? etc.
Thanks for the encouragement to hang in there in faith.
God bless
Tracy
```

```
Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-07-14 12:02:27)
Wow you have a thought provoking post with this scripture. I have another scripture that has been coming to me but
not sure I can make sense with it....Elijah was at a tough place with the water dried up.
```

Yes indeed Wanda very thought provoking, making a wonderful read.
Have a good day

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-07-14 14:20:35)
Wanda, what can I say? I’ve been looking around at the dryness and clinging to God. I’m praying for those who are
sinking, unable to hold on. It takes unshakable faith to stand still, to be still, even when things seem completely out
of the expected sequence.
Yet praising Him!!!!!

Joanne Sher (2011-07-14 17:00:45)
This passage grabbed me in Streams in the Desert too. Thanks so much for your thoughts. Waiting for Him is hard,
but we must.

Wanda, I never noticed this before. Elijah’s next instruction didn’t come until after the brook dried up. Wow! I want
to have that kind of relationship with my God, that no matter what, I won’t move until He says to go. Great post!

Peggy (mazmagi) (2011-07-15 01:27:45)
Blessing Wanda...What a thought provoking post about Elijah! I love how you pointed out his steadfastness beside
the brook! I guess I’ve found myself more than once along my own brook. Your questions were good for me. I enjoy
your insights and reflections as well as Streams in the Desert. Certainly appropriate in this case pointing out our frail
reactions. I think there may have been a time or two when I hung up my harp and paced. Ohhh the humanness of it
all. Hoping that I am done with doing it my way and that I’m learning to wait on the Lord!
You are so right! Sometimes God sends the same message from everywhere hoping we get the picture. Thanks for
sharing! Hope you enjoy a great weekend.
Thirsty for more.
Peace and JOY,
Peggy

Wanda (2011-07-15 22:42:32)
Yes He was Kim. If something keeps reoccurring it does us well to delve a little deeper to see what God may be trying
to relay to us. Hope you have a fantastic weekend!
Thanks, Yvonne. Always a pleasure to have you stop by.
Hi Tracy, I understand about how as time passing by doubts can try to creep in. Praying that your faith fails not.
Blessings to you.
Bluebutterfly clinging to the vine is the best place when can find ourselves in whatever season we may be.
Joanne, I’m learning more and more about the strength necessary to really wait upon Him.
Pam, it was one those things that I just couldn’t get past. Thus I wrote to try to make sense of the things in my
head. Pleasure to have you stop in.
Lisa, in all the times that I have read/heard of Elijah’s story, I hadn’t really paid much attention to it either.
Peggy hope you a wonderful weekend as well.

your quote box! You go girl! Love it!
Second, what a great observation! I probably would have been fearful and having a big ol’ pity party!
I just watched Moses (Ben Kingsley version) and placed myself in the shoes of the Israelites – in the shoes of Moses
as well. I wept and prayed for God to have mercy on all of us.
Thank you for sharing your heart!

Sharon (2011-07-18 21:07:49)
Oh Wanda, so eloquently spoken. It was really good to be reminded of this story of Elijah. I am comforted by the
example of these great pillars of the faith. They were also human, after all - and they got scared and discouraged.
But, their faith speaks to me and encourages me.
I do not wait patiently - because a ”dry brook” usually gets me nervous. Oh, how I must remember this fact - that
even in the driest desert wilderness, Living Water still flows!
GOD BLESS!

Arlee Bird (2011-07-19 04:25:44)
When everything’s going just fine in our lives it’s sometimes easy to put God at the back of our priority list and we
stop listening. It’s often in our times of trials that God’s voice becomes audible and we hear what he is telling us.

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-07-22 02:16:36)
Oh Wanda, I love this post! Yes, I have found myself sitting beside that dried-up brook. And, yes, I became antsy. No,
I didn’t move, I just prayed harder and tried to have faith during the dry spell. Then, I remembered what the Lord
told me to do in such circumstances: pray, listen, wait, have faith, and look more closely at the brook. Sometimes,
there is an obstruction in the way and all you have to do is move it. Many blessings and thank you, so much!

**Full but Empty (2011-07-22 14:31)**

The state of being full is in stark contrast to that of being empty. Funny how the two co-exist in our lives.
Looking around we see fullness all around us.

Closets bulging,

pantries full of outdated products,

medicine cabinets cramped with meds to heal our every ache and pain,

[1] calendars full of activities,

countertops cluttered with things.

With so much stuff to hold and find places for and so many things in which to busy ourselves, why does
beneath the fullness lies the often unvoiced feeling of emptiness within? Perhaps its not the things or to dos
in which we should be relying on for fullness.

This is written as part of Five Minute Friday, where you just write without worrying if its just right.

Shanda (2011-07-24 16:17:06)
Great post. I definitely agree that all our things consume so much of our time that we do not go to God like we should
to fill us up.

**How Much Does a Nation Weigh? (2011-07-25 12:00)**

What defines the weight or value of a nation? Is it its gross national product, [1]
population size, natural resources? Or perhaps its real value is found in its wealth or its military prowess.

On our humanistic scale each of these may be considered valid measures of a nations strength. However,
God doesnt see things in the same way. According to Isaiah 40:17, a nation equals nothing.

```
Compared to the Lord all nations are worth nothing; to him they are less than nothing.
(NCV)
```

A whole body of people end up in the red on Gods scale. Which is good news to me. It lets me know that
no matter what Im looking up at that seems colossal in my eyes, God can handle the weight of it.

Selah.

What is that has you weighted down with worry, doubt, confusion, frustration? Have you taken the matter
to God?

around my 18-year-old daughter and her wayward heart. I have been on my knees and will continue. God has a plan
for her and will turn this all around. Thanks for your post!

Nothing is too heavy for God. We can take all our burdens, worries, and cares to Him - He can handle it.

God’s scale is so different from ours. May we learn to measure our lives by his measurement instead of the measure-
ment of those around us. Speaking to myself here, too.

Wanda, my scales are woefully weighed down right now with several health concerns in my immediate family. I feel
crushed by them. But yes, thank you for reminding me that God holds those scales - and His love and wisdom and
guidance and presence FAR outweigh any struggles on the other side.

Oh, praise His name - I continue to take these matters to His feet. May I just have the strength and trust to leave
them there!
GOD BLESS!

**May He Do It For You (2011-07-30 15:57)**

In times of trouble, may the Lord answer your cry.
May the name of the God of Jacob keep you safe from all harm.
May he send you help from his sanctuary and strengthen you from Jerusalem.
May he remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings.

May he grant your hearts desires and make all your plans succeed.
May we shout for joy when we hear of your victory and raise a victory banner in the name of our God.
May the Lord answer all your prayers.

## 2.8 August

**Were All the Tears Wasted? (2011-08-01 12:33)**

Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
Psalm 126:6

[1] I must confess I am a crier. (I already feel better getting that off my chest&lol)
The tears flow on many occasions like when Im sad, frustrated, or angry. Just last night I was admitting
to someone that I cry, yep even at my age. I can recall times that my life was filled with tears. My every
morning cry was Lord help me to be better and not bitter. When your in a place of sorrow getting up and
getting out is no easy task. To get moving when you would rather just pull the covers up over your head
and call it a day is laborious. But to be purposeful in your sorrow and sow is even more admirable.

Have you ever had to serve others while inside you were weeping? God saw it even when no else could see
past the faÁade of your smile. He knows the struggle it was to continue on when you would have rather
stopped. But your coming back will not be the same as your going out. The weeping will not last.
Are you purposefully sowing even when you are experiencing personal sorrow? Are you able to sow a word of
encouragement, sow a smile, sow a good deed? Or do you find yourself too consume with your own problems
to realize that you still have something of value to give to others?

Hi Wanda - It is so hard to sow seed when inside you can barely breathe. We had a season of this recently and we
decided that the purpose of the hurt was to stop us sowing - so we were determined to continue sowing. It hurt, it
was hard - but I’m so glad we did.
God bless
Tracy

Pam (2011-08-01 13:28:28)
Tears can be a healing release. Thank you, Wanda, for reminding us that we can still be used by God, even in the
midst of our sorrow. Sometimes it actually helps others to see us keeping on even when we are hurting.

Wanda, I have had to serve through my tears - smile on the outside and personal sorrow on the inside. I have found

blessings!

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2011-08-02 00:35:31)
This is a good challenge, Wanda. I’ve found that sowing into others during my times of sorrow often made me feel
better. Very often if I was encouraging someone else with my words, I found that I was preaching to myself. The Holy
Spirit is so kind that way!
```

Wanda (2011-08-02 02:33:17)
What a wonderful testament to God’s ability to strengthen us even during the hard times, Traci.
So true Pam. I have certainly been encouraged by the perseverance of others.
Always a pleasure, Joanne. You guys always seem to pick verse that gets my wheels a turning.
Amen Lisa & Bluebutterfly.
You are right Yvonne, tears serve many purposes.
It is a challenge indeed Monica.

lioneagle (2011-08-02 11:46:40)
Hi Wanda -
Jesus wept.
Also, crying can be medicinal. It can bring relief.
Praise GOD that He wipes away all tears of sorrow... When we love, trust and obey Him, He certainly can bring tears
of joy!

Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-08-02 12:53:04)
I get sad but no tears for me, I wish I could cry more often. I can cry more with age, I think?

Thanks Wanda, I cried today! I wish I could give you a hug
My families demands and I’m left holding the bag, while they all go have fun. I’m tired of it; I feel like their Personal
Assistant, Taxi, Chef,...I’m tired I needed this post
Thank you! xXx

Shannon Lawrence (2011-08-03 02:35:03)
I’ve served while drowning in sorrow inside, BUT I think one can never be reminded enough that they will always

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-08-05 22:22:39)
I know exactly how you feel. There were times when I just didn’t want to move. But, I did. Afterwards, I was always
glad that I made the effort to live my life, but the sorrow remained. I’m so glad the Lord brought me out of that
particular pain. I’m just the opposite when it comes to helping others and not myself. I’d rather forget about me
and dwell on a task, job, or helping others. But, that wasn’t good for me. It allowed me to forget for a while, and
not address the issue. Either way you lean, you just better make sure it’s His shoulder you lean on. Thank you for

Hi Wanda,
I, too, am a crier. I’ve been called cry baby many times. But I’m not ashamed of it. Crying is good for the soul.
And yes, I have cried and have been in deep pain while sowing into others lives. It is NOT easy, but through much
prayer God got me through and now I’m reaping the blessings. Halleluja!!

This past year of ministry for us has been one of grieving. We are caught in between our loss of leaving Russia and
our new life here in Belize. We left behind people we dearly loved and served for five years. I can totally relate to
serving through tears.

Shanda (2011-08-09 18:05:49)
Wanda, I LOVE this. I want to never be so consumed by myself and my sorrow so as not to serve another.

Sharon (2011-08-10 14:42:11)
Wanda, this was so beautiful. I have recently found myself in a season of weeping, and it’s been difficult some days
to function. And yet, I still hear the still, small voice speaking through my tears - ”Peace, I am here.”
I loved your thought - ”your coming back will not be the same as your going out.” That’s my heartfelt prayer.
GOD BLESS!

**Young and In Love (2011-08-09 19:00)**

[1]

In a time when more people are foregoing marriage, Pastor Ted Cunninghams book, Young and In Love,

not only advocates marriage but he is a proponent of individuals tying the knot at younger ages.

```
We have adapted to getting our life in order first and marrying last. We dont want a spouse
to screw up our plans or tweak them.
```

While Young and in Love is a stark contrast to some of the ideologies I held toward marriage, I found
the author made valid arguments that challenged my thinking and made me reconsider what I deemed as
essentials for marriage. I love it when a book does this. He points out consequences to delayed marriage
such as: removal of grandparents from families, prolonged adolescent, self-centeredness, independence, and
fewer choices in partners.

```
You see, time alone is not the primary tool of character building. We develop our characters
through pain, trials, and difficulty and by how we choose to handle this adversity, not through
simple independence. Marriage offers plenty of opportunities to grow our character because it
forces us to think about someone other than ourselves.
```

I found that he painted a balanced view of unnecessary delays like money, career, dream weddings, living
together and waiting to find your soul-mate with necessary delays such as completing high school, avoiding
rushes due to pregnancy, military deployment or desire for sex, and dating someone who is not a believer.
Pastor Cunningham does not encourage recklessly jumping into marriage but rather guides them into exam-
ining the four Cs: character, chemistry, competency, and calling.

Who is the book for?

According to the author, the book is not for those who are decidedly single, seeking love but can not find it,
nor for those seeking to learn contentment while waiting to be found. Instead, Pastor Cunningham targets
this book for those who are in their late teens or early 20s , already in love with someone and desiring to
marry but are meeting the you are too young opposition by family and friends. Admittedly, I dont fall into
this category but the premise of the book still drew my attention due to my curiosity regarding what makes
marriages work.

Whether you are young and in love, a parent, or just family member of someone who is, I would recommend
reading this book. You might find that you are one of the little foxes that could destroy love and/or marriage.

From the back cover:

Developing a godly relationship can be hard when you fall in love at a young age. Few people offer support.
Many doubt your love is real. It seems almost everyone-your friends, your parents, even your church-thinks
youre much too young for marriage. Youre not ready. But maybe thats not true.

Pastor Ted Cunningham reveals the secrets to creating a healthy, successful, and lifelong relationship in early
adulthood. He explains where the arguments against young marriage often go wrong. Then he offers wisdom
on how to know if you are making the right choice and helps you understand what it takes to be ready for
marriage. And along the way, he sows you that, far from kissing dating good-bye, the answer to staying pure
might be to prepare for marriage. Because its often easier to say, Lets wait, when I do isnt so far away.

Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary copy of the book by The B &B Media Group in exchanged for
my unbiased review.

Margaret Mitchell is better than my score! I write like ”Stephen King” with one post, ewww I do not like horror! The

{Inspire Me,Beautiful.} (2011-08-15 17:11:30)
This was fun to do. My first post I submitted it said I wrote like William Shakespeare. It was because I had several
KJV Bible verses in there. :)
The next one said I wrote like Cory Doctorow.
It kind of gives you perspective on your writing style.
Thank you for this! :)

Hey Wanda, how are you beautiful lady?!
I love this. I will have to do this and post it on my blog as well.
I’m scared mine will be something crazy as I’m not a ”writer” by definition. I just write what the Lord gives me to
write.

How are you? Life is taking a turn, as the weather cools a bit. I have missed you Sorry I haven’t been by; my

I love this; so fun...but I don’t have any clue who the author is.
I write like David Foster Wallace

Isn’t Blog Land a wonderland? There are so many terrific people out there, and God uses so many personalities and
styles to get His messages out. I think it’s great.
I haven’t done the analysis yet - but I’d have to guess that I’m a cross between Charles Dickens and Dr. Seuss -
sometimes wordy, sometimes silly!
And for the record, Wanda (Margaret Mitchell) - I LOVE your style, and am consistently blessed by how and what
you share from your heart.
GOD BLESS!

**Do Your Own Job (2011-08-19 10:59)**

```
It isnt your responsibility to plan your future. That has been planned before your life began
(remember He saw every day of your life before you were born). You are being conformed to His
image. Every incident, every setback, every disappointment, every unexpected tragedy are to be
used to further His purpose of conforming you to His likeness in your life and in my life.
```

This quote stood out to me in a devotional I read this morning by Anabel Gillham. I have been guilty lately
of trying to work out the details of my life and nothing has come together as I had planned. And then comes
along these words to warn me that I have attempted to take on a job that is not my responsibility.

What a good quote and so appropriate for my life right now. I keep trying to plan every detail. It’s comforting to

Oh ladies I’m glad to know I’m not alone. It’s weird that I have this head knowledge that He is ultimately in control
but at times I find it so easy to get into trying to work the plan, which is one I don’t even fully know. Other than His
Word promises that He will take all things and work it for my God for those who love Him. Carol by all means copy,
I cited the author of it.

```
Sharon (2011-08-21 22:51:40)
Great words, Wanda. Very timely for me. Yes, it’s so very difficult to rely on the Lord, and then to rest in that
abiding sense of dependence. It’s the prideful urge to control that so often thwarts God in His work to make us like
His Son.
Oh, that I could stay out of His way!!
GOD BLESS!

**Spiritual Warfare for Women (2011-08-23 05:01)**

Can what you dont know be hurting your home? Your family? Your friends?
According to Leighann McCoy the answer is a resounding YES. In her latest book, Spiritual Warfare for
Women, she tackles the subject-spiritual warfare- that many Christians would just assume to pretend doesnt
really exist. But whether we admit it or not we are all in a spiritual battle. She aims not only to make us
aware that there is a real war going on but acts as a spiritual coach helping women to identify the key areas
in which the enemy wages battle against us and arms us with strategies for winning.

Heres quote from the book that points out how subtle the enemys tactics are:

```
Caricatures would have you believe that he is a dragon surrounded by fire, or a red monster
with horns and a forked tail, or even a slimy snake ready to strike. But most often the devil
comes in the form of a compassionate man who is eager to hear how your man isnt measuring
up&or a chocolate cupcake piled high with icing that promises to make you feel better for yelling
your kids this morning&or a friend eager to hear the intimate details of your problems at home
so that she can offer her compassion and remind you that you are too good to put up with that.
Never does the object of temptation reveal itself to be as wicked as it truly is.
```

The book is divided into four sections:

• Part One: The Most Powerful Weapon of All-Gods Love
• Part Two: The Enemy Exposed
• Part Three: The Targets in Our Lives
• Part Four: Victory is Mine

Each chapter of the book concludes with scriptures to sharpen your sword and creative exercises to help you
commit the Word to memory, which I really liked. McCoy uses a conversational style tone and shares her
own personal battles with cancer and raising her teen daughter.

About the Author:
Leighann McCoy is sought-after speaker and writer. She is the prayer and womens minister at a large
Southern Baptist Church where her husband serves as pastor, and she has written a number of devotionals
and Bible studies for women. She lives with her family in Franklin, Tennessee.

been on my heart for a while. I can’t wait to begin. Thanks!!

**In Expectation (2011-08-24 13:07)**

```
Yet my friends laugh at me, for I call on God and expect an answer. Job 12:4a (NLT)
```

Notice the two verbs in the last section of the passage. One of the definition of call is to make a request or

demand, which sounds like prayer to me.[1] For many of us calling on God
has become a part of daily lives even if its not for extended periods of prayer time, we find ourselves sending
up quick Lord help me prayers.
But what is it that you expect from your calling? Do you really anticipate that He will answer? Or have
you grown accustomed to calling on Him about the same condition so long that your level of expectation of
change has diminished?
As I examined myself in light of this scripture, that wouldnt let me just cruise on by in my reading, I had
to admit that there are some places in my life that my expectation of His answer showing up had dwindled.
Oh Lord forgive me for not fully placing my confidence in you. Thank you for loving me enough that you
would bring light to this area of my life. I pray for my brothers and sisters who are also experiencing
diminished expectations in areas of their lives. I pray that their faith would be stirred a new. In Jesus name,
Amen.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-08-24 14:30:40)
Well, Wanda, I too must admit that there are some things that I have simply given up all expectation of. Yet, your
words brought back to me one of my favorite verses:
”Don’t be afraid. Since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God,
your request has been heard in heaven. I have come in answer to your prayer. - Daniel 10:12
```

```
My daily walk in His grace! (2011-08-24 14:35:59)
Hi Wanda - I love this post but I also really love how you said, ”I examined myself in light of this scripture”. That is
what we should be doing.
Great post
God bless

Pam (2011-08-24 15:09:32)
This seems to be a recurring theme that God is reminding me of the last few weeks. Thank you for confronting us
with Scripture, Wanda. With it you bring hope for what seems impossible.
Blessings!

Susie Swanson (2011-08-25 00:32:45)
I love this Wanda. I agree we all should examine ourselves more often. Thank you for your uplifting post..Susie

Sharon (2011-08-26 00:00:46)
Good convicting message, Wanda. I have a few things that truthfully I don’t even pray much about anymore. Isn’t
that awful to admit that??
Thank for giving me the encouragement to renew my hope, and to learn once again that I must pray without ceasing
over these seemingly impossible things.
All things are ”HIM-possible” with the Lord!
GOD BLESS!

Joanne Sher (2011-08-26 00:35:26)
So needed that reminder. We have to EXPECT His answer, or we are not praying in faith. Thanks, Wanda.

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-08-26 00:46:17)
Could it be that God has taken care of those areas in our lives and caused us to move forward? I often wonder about
this. What seemed in need of repair and refurbishment last year, just seems to drop away, in importance. Thank you,
for this post, as I am going to go back through my journals and think about what has changed in me and my faith.
Is there an area that I have given-up hope of repair or does it no longer need repair? Many blessings!
P.S. I’m so glad you liked your bookmarks. If you need more, let me know. Blessings!

Alida (2011-08-26 08:53:38)
Thank you for sharing this...it really speaks to me today. I have almost given up on a few situations we are facing.

Just Be Real (2011-08-27 11:39:33)
deep provoking words here Wanda. Examining our own heart is where it begins. Blessings.

lioneagle (2011-08-27 14:54:11)
Hi Wanda -
A new fruitful journey is ahead for you. Prepare for the fresh revelations. Our Lord will quicken you and give power
to your faintness. Cleave to Him and KNOW that bountiful avenues will be in your ”travel” plans. Have no fear,
JESUS abides in you as you abide in Him.
Satan hinders but He cannot cancel GOD’S plans...

Mike (2011-08-29 12:28:08)
Yes, really tough for those long term struggles. But God loves faith right? May I have the perseverance to keep
knocking and asking!

Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-09-07 13:02:25)
I love this! I do not want to call on God only when things are tough....want to call on Him for daily fellowship.

**Everybody Needs a Stripper in Their Life (2011-08-30 05:01)**

Whats your chosen strippers name? Not the one swinging on the pole. Or the one that[1]

stimulates your sensuality. Oh no Im referring to the one that was used
as an agent of change in your life. Strippers come in array of disguises. Just take a look at Josephs story in
the Bible.

In Genesis 37, we find the story of this young man, who was favored my his father but hated my his own
brothers. Joseph was adorned with a special coat signifying the esteemed position he held in his fathers eyes.
And if that was not enough, he was a dreamer. All of this contributed to him being put on the strippers hit
list. For him, his strippers were cloaked in the form of his own brothers. They were determined to dash his
hope and kill his dreams so much so that they set a plot to fake his death and secretly sale him into slavery.

But that wasnt the end of Josephs story. I would imagine that his route from favor to the pit to the place
brought about a level of maturity in him that he would have never gained had he not had to experience the
heat of his brothers vendetta.
Our strippers may not be people but perhaps they are situations like failed marriages, physical/sexual abuse,
rejection or disappointments. Regardless of the form the stripper comes in, its purpose is the same to render
you void of hope, dreams, faith, and identity.
However your story (and my story) doesnt have to end there. God can take all of stuff we encounter in this
life and work it for our good. Some things like pride, selfishness, and independence gets worked out of us
while other things such as perseverance, gentleness, meekness, and love get worked in us.
Are there some situations in your life that is attempting to hold you hostage and keep you in the grips of
pain and despair. If so maybe its time you look at from a different perspective, so that you may be able to
proclaim the enemy meant for your harm but God worked for your good.

Love this! And I am so grateful that God works it all out for good.

Tracy Teppler (2011-08-30 12:24:54)
Hi Wanda - great post :) Kind of feel like I’m being sanded right now! Great encouragement
God bless

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-08-30 13:15:59)
Well, well, Wanda, once again, it seems as if you are in my brain. One of my favorite verses come from Joseph’s story,
and that verse has been strengthening me. It says this:
So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his
clothes, he came before Pharaoh. - Genesis 41:14
I remind myself daily that we can be ”quickly brought from the dungeon” into our divine destiny.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-08-30 13:32:57)
A wonderful post Wanda, You chose an eye catching title.
Yvonne.

Ella (2011-08-30 14:05:07)
Wow, strippers...yes, I have had a few of those in my life. I think I still do...time to push them aside and forge new
paths! Thanks for the reminder...they do bring us down, if we aren’t careful! xXx

Dawn (2011-08-30 14:43:20)
Found you on Faith Barista....
Love this–
”I would imagine that his route from favor to the pit to the place brought about a level of maturity in him that he
would have never gained had he not had to experience the heat of his brothers vendetta.”
So true, even for us today!

Lisa (2011-08-30 18:10:34)
This is good, Wanda! God has been working to remove some things from my life through His gentle stripping. All
things work together for good. So thankful for that truth!

Just Be Real (2011-08-31 13:20:30)
The title really intrigued me Wanda. Wonderful post and message. Blessings.

Faith Imagined (2011-08-31 18:25:24)
You always give strong messages in a way that makes it easy to understand. You are such an annoited writer!
This pushes me to fully embrace my strippers realizing I’ll be a better Christian from them. Thank you!

Toia (2011-09-01 02:56:48)
This is a great post. I love the analogy. This post gives me alot to think about. Blessings to you!!!

Bernadine (2011-09-04 02:43:08)
Great post Wanda. I’m so glad that no matter how bad our stuff is God can work it out for our good.

Reformed rebel (2011-09-07 23:42:21)
Hi Wanda Strippers...Wow! Never thought of it like that before. However God has been working on me lately and
”stripping” away things that I have been holding on to for way too long. Thank you for this...well timed for me!
Blessings...Chelle
```

```
Sharon (2011-09-08 20:46:57)
OK, Wanda - a clever and catchy title!
I have to admit, many of the stripping times in my life came from my own doing. But God uses everything for His
good if we turn to Him.
Health, money, family issues - happy times and sad - they are all part of the re-tooling that the Master Carpenter is
doing in our lives.
I am so grateful that He cares - for instance, He didn’t leave Adam and Eve naked - He clothed them. This shows me
that though those times of being stripped will come - God will also be there to clothe me with robes of righteousness.
GOD BLESS!

## 2.9 September

**Popping In (2011-09-15 07:17)**

As you may have noticed things have been rather quiet around these parts. However, I havent stopped
thinking of you. I cant really pinpoint the reason for my silence other than Im in the midst of life changes.
Changes big or small (good or bad) can leave us disoriented, out of alignment and need of a second wind.
So as I gather my thoughts and breathe His fresh breath again would you whisper a pray for me, as I pray
for you.

Before I go I wanted to share a song with you I heard on Sunday that was touching to me and in case you
dont have time to listen. Heres the lyrics to A Move of God is On the Way courtesy of elyrics.net.
I feel a breakthrough coming your way,
it’s a mighty move of God,
it’s gonna change your day.
With signs and wonders, miracles to perform,
God is gonna bless you for just holding on.

Just hold on, a change is coming,
feel it in the air,
it’s in the atmosphere.
Just hold on, a change is coming,
a move of God is on the way.
You’ve been expecting a change in your life,
looking for your midnight to turn to sunshine.
It’s gonna happen, you wait and see,
all things are possible to them that believe.
Just hold on, a change is coming,
feel it in the air,

it’s in the atmosphere.
Just hold on, a change is coming...
A move of God is on the way. [EMBED]

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-09-15 09:45:15)
Wanda, I have been praying for you. I now call to mind a Psalm that brings me great strength:
Psalm 138
1-3. Thank You! Everything in me says ”Thank You!” Angels listen as I sing my thanks. I kneel in worship facing
Your holy temple and say it again: ”Thank You!”
Thank You for Your love, thank You for Your faithfulness; Most holy is Your name, most holy is Your Word. The
moment I called out, You stepped in; You made my life large with strength.
4-6. When they hear what You have to say, God, all earth’s kings will say ”Thank You.” They’ll sing of what You’ve
done: ”How great the glory of God!” And here’s why: God, high above, sees far below; no matter the distance, He
knows everything about us.
7-8. When I walk into the thick of trouble, keep me alive in the angry turmoil. With one hand strike my foes, with
Your other hand save me. Finish what You started in me, God. Your love is eternaldon’t quit on me now
```

```

Dawn M. Hamsher (2011-09-18 14:53:51)
Our pastor talked about change today. Most change we view as bad, but when it comes to Christ, that is a good
change. If we allow him, he comes in and cleans house and gets rid of the bad habits and the sin.
This is a time of season change too. A good time to re-focus on Christ.
Blessings in your time of change. Talk to you soon!
```

Just Be Real (2011-09-18 15:19:23)

Sharon (2011-09-18 16:04:41)
Wanda, I have noticed you being a little MIA! I will be praying for you as you face life changes. I know well the
unsettling feeling that comes when things get a little (or a lot) topsy-turvy.
Thanks for the song. It was particularly uplifting as I’m considering some changes in my life, too. This was the best:
”A move of God is on the way.”
Oh yes, indeed.
Will eagerly await your return!
GOD BLESS!

Prayer Notes by Cynthia (2011-09-21 14:06:43)
Praying for you, Wanda. Asking the Lord to keep His loving arms around you and guide your footsteps. Here is a
prayer I wrote about seeking His direction:
Dear and Precious Lord,
There is so much that I want to accomplish for You, in this lifetime. Yet, my thoughts are scattered and my path is
unclear.
I ask that You clear my thoughts and direct my footsteps so that I may be a vessel for Your work.
Place me where You want me to be.
Keep me safe in the face of danger.
Put the words in my mouth that
You would have me say.
For, I know that I am useless without You, but made invincible,
with You at my side.
Although I may be afraid,
give me the courage to set my fear aside, and follow Your path.
Remove all of my obstacles, Lord,
and, illuminate my way.
Let Your work be done, in me, through me, and in spite of me.
This, I ask, in Your Most Holy Name&.Amen.
prayer notes

LisaShaw (2011-09-22 17:35:03)
Praying for you dear sister! I understand the season...we all go through them. Keep close to God’s Word and heart
as He ministers to you. Much love!

**Let It Be Settled (2011-09-22 11:34)**

```
He is settled in his mind that Jehovah will take care of him. Psalm 112:7b (TLB)
```

Is the question of God being on your side settled in your mind?
Amongst all the turmoil that you have experienced or are experiencing in your life, are you convinced that
God will carry you through it?
Through the crooks, turns, valleys, caves, and rough terrain are you convinced that indeed the Father has a
plan for you life?
As I came across Psalm 112:7, those are the questions Im asking myself. Its easy to give off the expected
answer of yes. But does my actions, my moods, my speech line up with that confession is the real question.

```
Tracy (2011-09-22 11:46:37)
Excellent Wanda - let it be settled. God said it, I believe it, that settles it. Now I must act like all the above is in my
heart :)
God bless
Tracy
```

```
Angela Felsted (2011-09-22 13:17:19)
That is the hardest question of all, because no matter how hard we try we can never truly measure up. And it’s up
to us to have faith that our best is good enough for God.
```

```
Joanne Sher (2011-09-22 13:28:03)
Excellent thoughts, Wanda. The head ALWAYS says yes - but do we live that way? Praying I do.
```

```
Lisa (2011-09-22 15:25:59)
Great question, Wanda. The quick, expected answer is yes. But God wants us to do more reflection and introspection.
Many blessings!
```

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-09-22 15:50:47)
Wanda, Wanda, that question made be feel like Paul...I want to do right, but then...and I don’t want to do wrong,
and then. At the beginning of this week, I had to - again - remind myself to ”stop flirting with God” and settle it in
my mind that ”Our faith may fail, His never wanes- That’s who He is, He cannot change!” 2 Timothy 2:13
Standing on the Everlasting Rock and holding on for dear life.
```

```
LisaShaw (2011-09-22 23:33:43)
Amen Wanda! Your last paragraph said it best!
From December 2010 until May 2011 I was very ill. Dropped 43 lbs and saw 5 specialist and 2 regular dr’s. Went
through all sorts of medicines, even some that they should not have given to me apparently. I had to stand on God’s
Word even in moments when I felt like folding due to pain and not knowing what was wrong. It was then I reminded
myself that my FAITH IS IN GOD in the good and in the bad. ”Where is our faith when all hell is breaking loose?”
Faith in God is not meant for just when everything is going good but for sure when all seems to be going wrong.
I appreciate you and miss you!
```

```
Wanda (2011-09-23 00:23:58)
Hi Lisa, missed you too sweet sister. Thanks for sharing your testimony.
Bluebutterfly, I read that post of yours and it was oh so powerful girl!

Beck Gambill (2011-09-23 14:46:38)
Our actions tell on us don’t they! I’m settled in my mind that God is on my side, or more importantly I’m on his,
but I’m going to watch my actions today to see what I really believe!
```

```
Belbin9 (2011-09-24 03:44:32)

Just Be Real (2011-09-24 09:28:58)
It is the only thing that keeps me going. Even if I do not feel God always with me, just having the faith that He is
helps.

```
Sharon (2011-09-24 23:17:11)
Great question, Wanda. Yes, it is settled in my mind. God is for me, on my side, through thick and thin. Now that
doesn’t mean that I understand what He’s doing all the time - nor does it mean that I like it! But, I am doing my
best to learn how to align my actions, my moods, my speech with the Truth that I believe in my heart...
If God is for me, who can ever be against me?
GOD BLESS!

**Three Things (2011-09-26 12:14)**

These lists are fabulous. I especially like how you narrowed down destroying factors to three: Lust, Pride, Anger.

LisaShaw (2011-09-27 13:47:27)
Simplistic and POWERFUL! Amen! Thanks for sharing with us! I would add to the things that can destroy...FEAR
when not managed by the Holy Spirit. I lived it so I know first hand.
Hey, I shared your ”writing style” post on my blog this morning. A little late :) but wanted to share it!
Blessings and love sis!

Sharon (2011-09-27 21:21:22)
Beautifully simple, and simply beautiful.
Yes, and isn’t it interesting that the three things that are most valuable come from the heart of God...
He alone is the unchanging Three-In-One. The same yesterday, today, and forever.
GOD BLESS!

## 2.10 October

**Refreshed (2011-10-03 02:10)**

Its been no real secret, I have been wandering around in a dry place. A place of shadows that threaten to
overtake me. A place where the taunts of the enemy are heard screeching louder and louder in my ears. A
place of taking two steps but seeming to make no ground at all.
But today something change. I feel revived and refreshed. I feel as if I can continue this journey with
renewed vigor and passion. Only God can change a dry place to a watered garden. This blog was birthed
out of a Isaiah 58:11 experience. That passage of scripture serves as the backdrop for all that is written or
shared here. Hard to believe that its been over one year and 272 posts ago since I typed my first post. Im
so grateful for each of you that have joined me here as I rediscovered my voice.

```
Sharon (2011-10-03 04:41:54)
I have missed your voice, Wanda. And I praise God that He has revived your heart and refreshed your spirit!
The father of lies is such an incessant enemy - and he is so clever at devising ways to silence us. We must not let
him...
Put those warrior shoes back on, and let him know that you will not be stilled...
You will stand.
GOD BLESS!
```

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-10-03 14:46:51)
You’ve been such a blessing, Wanda. As I read your honest words, I was reminded of what we often forget: Satan is
brash; a bully. Specifically, I remembered his challenge to Jesus after His days of fasting; attempting to get Him to
deny His source. That bully satan is ALWAYS looking for an opportunity to challenge our foundation. He will fail.
The NAME OF THE LORD is our tower and God will defend us. He is the glory and the one who lifts your head. He
honors you as His unique creation. There is no place so dark that we are beyond His love. He is our God, our healer,
our breath. ”He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to His name.” - Psalm 23:3
```

**Muslim in the Midst (2011-10-03 12:25)**

Im sending out a request to my brothers and sisters in Christ today. I have come across an unexpected
challenge in my life. For anyone that has visited here knows, Im unapologetically Christian while respecting
the right of others to choose differently. My path has crossed with that of someone who is of Muslim faith,
which I know very little about. Since I believe that NO thing enters my life without the permission of God,
I believe that our meeting is not without purpose. However, I do not want to set up our encounters to be
one debate. Can anyone of you share ideas/tips or your personal experience with a similar situation?

Thanks for your help.

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-10-03 14:32:20)
Wanda, this is a definite opportunity to ”live your faith”. I have many friends of different faiths, but I must tell you
that I was thoroughly blessed by a Muslim I met in 2009. She came into my life in my role as caregiver. We had
prayed for the right nurse during a very critical time. We have had every type of nurse over the years, but this was
do or die (as in sent home to die) and we knew it. In the door walked this tiny woman, veiled. When she walked in,
I knew she was the one. I can’t even explain it. Out of her mouth came words of faith and life and her spirit was
undeniably of God. We talked about our histories, about how God had helped us during our lifetime and how we
serve the lives around us. Our connection flowed, no arguments, no battles against each other. It was and still is a
time of acknowledging the miracles and the work of God unto His glory. She has been touched; I have been touched.
I really believe that you will touch this life and be touched yourself. Go with the flow of God’s spirit. You will look
back and see the footprints of God all over this opportunity.
```

```
Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-10-03 17:54:35)
I do not believe we should argue our faith. We just live it and they will see it...I have not much experience with
Muslims but non-believers are around me...
```

```
Alice Lynn Alfred (2011-10-03 19:31:39)
Dear friend I know with any religion, or any person, religious or not, who does not know Jesus as their personal Lord
and Savior, what will change them is the same thing that changes you and I.....the LOVE of God. Religion is all about
”works” and proving you are ok based upon your behavior. Jesus is different because He is about love and grace and
our works are NOTHING. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and show much grace....and talk of your LOVE for JESUS, and His
GRACE....this will make any Muslim question their own faith....and though they may act defensive or self-righteous
in the face of truth....God is at work. PS thank you for the wonderful visit and comment over at my place!! Much
love alice
```

Lisa (2011-10-03 19:33:15)
Wanda, I’m with BlueButterfly, there is a purpose in this meeting, and I think you already feel that. Build upon your
common beliefs. You both believe in God, kindness, joy and living a good life. Talk and rejoice in your similarities.
Remember that contention is of the devil and a spirit of debate and angry only furthers the unholy one’s cause. Go
forward in faith and Christ will be with you always. Much love and blessings to you!

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-10-03 20:23:28)
I’m sure God has sent this person into your life for a purpose, once you know what that purpose is then all will become
clear.
With all faiths we all believe in God and that can’t be bad can it?
Yvonne.

Arlee Bird (2011-10-03 22:20:43)
I avoid arguing religion with others unless it’s someone who is very close to me and we have a certain mutual playing
field and respect for each other.
In your case I would learn as much as I could about Islam just in case the discussion ever arises. It’s difficult to defend
one’s faith against someone who knows more about both. I think it is important to understand that Muslims reject
the concept of the Trinity and that Jesus is part of the Godhead. They see Mohammed as more important than Jesus
Christ and that is a pretty major difference.
If we can live in peace and mutual respect that’s a great thing, but the differences in beliefs ultimately can cause
friction.

Wanda (2011-10-04 00:11:16)
Bluebutterfly, thanks for sharing your personal experience and words of wisdom.
Kim, I’m definitely not one to argue. I believe God can do a much better job that I ever could of defending Himself.
Alice, enjoyed my visit to your place and thanks for the sharing your insights with me.
Lisa, totally agree with what you said.
Yvonne, I agree that it’s not without purposes. It just isn’t always clear from the beginning.
Differing belief systems can cause contention. Thank you Arlee for sharing more about Islam. I plan to do a bit more
research on it.

Pam (2011-10-04 02:05:16)
Praying for you, Wanda. Just had a discussion this evening at Stephen’s Ministry Training about 1 Corinthians 2:1-5,
especially verses 3-5 ”When I came to you, I was weak and trembled all over with fear, and my teaching and message
were not delivered with skillful words of human wisdom, but with convincing proof of the power of God’s Spirit. Your
faith, then, does not rest on human wisdom but on God’s power.” God knows your heart and will guide your words.
Blessings!

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2011-10-05 01:37:40)
Wanda, I have recently met someone who was raised Muslim, but was exposed to Christianity by other family members.
Today, she ”borrows principles” from them both and incorporates them into her lifestyle. I’ve had some interesting
conversations with her. I’m like you. I’m not well versed on their faith. However, I continue to be strong in the Lord
before her. I know you are sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit. If He leads you into an opportunity to discuss
faith, I know you will speak the truth in love. Love is truly the key. In the meantime, as you said, there’s a reason
for everything. If nothing else, you have an opportunity to be a picture of Christ in this person’s presence.

```
lioneagle (2011-10-06 00:18:55)
Hi Wanda -
I have encountered Muslims who I have addressed as ”Precious...”
It is important to glow with the love of our Father because He is love. Yes, we have different beliefs but love is core
to our engagements.
I’m not familiar with how to effectively witness to them so the best that I can offer is that when I encounter them I
love and respect them....
It may be a good idea to find a common demoninator, such as if they like to cook and you share that passion...
```

```
LisaShaw (2011-10-06 15:25:21)
What a beautiful opportunity for you to live, show and extend Christs love in your connection with them. As one
whose brother was a Muslim until over a year ago; I have been saved since I was 12 and he a Muslim since he was
an upper teen; and I loved him and shared Christ verbally but EVEN MORE in my walk before him so that he’d see
Christ love at work. He is not saved YET but he is no longer a Muslim. He is searching/seeking and I know he is ripe
for falling into the arms of God. It was me who he called to say he was no longer a Muslim and asked me to pray for
him. He said, ”Sis you’ve always lived your faith out loud with love”. That’s humbling and it’s the key Wanda. Live
your faith out loud with love!
Praying for you as God uses you to touch the person He’s allowed to enter your life.

**Cherished by Kim Cash Tate (2011-10-04 08:00)**

A novel of unconditional love

[1] Having read Kim Tates previous book Faithful, I was excited about reading
her new novel Cherished and I was not disappointed. Mrs. Tate does an excellent job of exploring the
challenges of real life and faith. Through her latest book readers will be forced to examine their own lives for
areas of unforgiveness and evidence of them fully accepting Gods unconditional love. Even when we know
what Gods Word says, its often hard to forgive ourselves and accept that we are His beloved.

The central storyline focuses on Kelli London, a single sister trying to bury the pain and guilt of an abortion
she had in her teens, and Brian, her high school sweetheart. However, readers also reunited with other
characters like Heather, Cyd and Dana from Faithful. It was pleasure to get reacquainted with each of these
characters.

No matter ones walk of life, I believe that readers can identify with having felt unusable and that a dream
was lost. Below is one my favorite quotes from the book:

```
For years she thought her dreams had turned to dust-dreams of music, dreams of future with
Brian. God had brought the dreams back, but in ways she never could have imagined&out of a
pain she never thought she could endure. Would she had dreamed those dreams, had she known?
pg. 305
```

Indeed this book is about unconditional love, acceptance, Gods grace, mercy and restoration. Thoroughly
enjoyed reading this book and my only criticism was how neatly everything seem to wrap up in the end,
which I dont believe is always the case in life.

Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy for review purposes from The B &B Media group. Views and
opinions expressed are my own.

**Reclaiming Ancient Paths (2011-10-10 13:58)**

[1]

```
This is what the LORD says: Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths,
ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said,
We will not walk in it.” Jeremiah 6:16
```

I admit Im not one that appreciates the value and/or beauty of antiques. Like many, I have an eye for
whats new or modern. Much of advertising today is aimed at keeping us in pursuit of the latest it thing.
Values such as modesty, monogamy, integrity, discretion are not portrayed as essential but are considered
out-of-date. But is new always better?

In this particular passage, the people are instructed to pause and really look. To not just forge ahead making
decisions mindlessly but to be conscious. Our lives are filled with crossroad moments and if we are not
careful we can find ourselves on the wide open path of doing what is expected. Aimlessly following the
culture instead of choosing a path with far less glitz and glam, accolades, or notoriety.
But the seeking for the latest and greatest is not where true satisfaction lies. Rather its discovered when go
back to doing things Gods way that we find rest for our souls.
At this very moment youve entered a crossroad, which path will you choose?

Wanda, this is really good! I’m learning to appreciate antiques now, but I’ve always been about the latest and greatest
too. But I don’t want to run after things just because they are new or even because they are old. I want to run after
the things of God. That’s all that matters.

Wanda, this verse is a direction from the Lord for me today.

See another crossroads ;D

Faith Imagined (2011-10-12 05:08:06)
That is what God is really teaching me lately – to pause and really look. I think our culture keeps us so rushed that
we don’t realize that history gives us insight into the paths we should take! Thank you for such a beautiful post!

susanwalkergirl (2011-10-12 14:50:28)
Very good post Wanda. We must be wise and mindful that we are engaged in a spiritual battle every day.

wisely.

I really love that verse. Sometimes when we get confused along the way, we need to return to a place where God is
waiting to lead us again.
I am a huge antique-lover. I love them because of the stories that come with them. They remind me of simpler times.
That’s also what God wants for us - His way is narrow, and difficult - but it is the simple path of LIFE!
I am choosing to follow the Lord - not sure where the path is leading - but I know my Guide.
GOD BLESS!

THANK YOU, LORD, for how YOU enrich us with YOU. How grateful we are that YOU are the same yesterday,
today and forever!!!

**Embracing Farewell (2011-10-14 12:37)**

Growing up I have always been shy, which didnt lend itself to making large number of friends. Instead I

chose to develop a small circle of friends.[1] I have always envied my
siblings outgoing personality but it just never came that easy for me. Letting someone new in is never easy
for me. So you can imagine how difficult goodbye must be.

But as you know, God never leaves us in our places of comfort for too long. He nudges us and at times gives
us a big push in order to produce growth in our lives. Thats what He has been doing for me in the past few
months of this year. Hes taken me down new roads meeting new people and encountering new experiences.
At times I have trodden along timidly and other times a bit defiantly, kicking, screaming, and pleading that
He give me a moment to catch my breath.
Once I have said hello to something new I long to cling to it but I have experienced quite a few exits that
caused me to grieve and question why I had to go through the experience. But God in His kindness has been
teaching me the true value of goodbye. When I clutch onto to the things in my life that He has chosen to
usher out, I keep myself stuck and stunted. It is the farewells of life that makes room for new hellos.
Father help me (and others like me) to embrace what youre doing now. Teach us how to mourn during the
allotted time but not to get stuck there. Lord I thank you for the ability to move forward in You. Thank

you that as we walk along lifes journey you are with us! We chose to place our confidence in You and in
Your ability to guide us along the right paths for lives. In Jesus name, Amen.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-10-14 14:03:30)
Wow! Wow! Wow! What can I say? When you read my blog today you will understand. God is good; He knows the
way that we should take. Goodbyes are difficult, but absolutely necessary. I’ve been meditating on Romans 5, and
what it means to stand in this place of the ”undeserved privilege” of His grace:
”...Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully
look forward to sharing Gods glory. We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they
help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident
hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he
has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love...”

Hi Wanda - its so true what you say that if God wants us to let something go, and we don’t, it hurts and harms us,
or stunts us. Something to definitely think on with issues I hold on to. Thank you
God bless

Pam (2011-10-14 15:00:33)
My husband, our children, and I have moved A LOT during our lifetimes. It is always difficult saying Goodbye–not
just to the friends we have made but to the familiar and comforting. I always feel like a deer caught in the headlights
when we walk into a new church. But God has always been faithful and along with all the scary parts of new places
and new people have come new blessings and new friends. If I had been unwilling to let go of the past, I would never
have met some of these wonderful people or experienced the thrill of new adventures. So, with God, it is always worth
it to step out in faith. Thanks for the reminder Wanda! Have a blessed weekend my friend!

Wanda (2011-10-14 16:42:38)
You know I had to hurry over and read your post Bluebutterfly. And it serves as confirmation to what God has been
teaching me. Funny thing is this post has been brewing in my spirit and heart for days but I finally felt the push to
release it. I pray that others that stop by will read your post. It bless me and I know others will be blessed as well.

”It is the farewells of life that make room for new hellos.”

Pamela (2011-10-14 19:36:21)
I understand the sister thing. We’d go to the mall and my sister would say, ”I hope I see someone we know.” I’d say,
”I hope we don’t see anyone we know.” But you’re right about the fact that sometimes we need to say good bye to the
comfort zone. I’m always blessed when I do.
Blessings,
Pamela

Hi Wanda -
Thank you. I enjoyed this message.
Do you remember the song, ”It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday?”
That came to mind after I read this.
Yes, Goodbyes can be challenging but as the Spirit of GOD leads, we must follow.
This is an encouraging and hopeful piece, Wanda.

Karen (2011-10-16 13:44:02)
I prayed that prayer with you this morning, Wanda! Thank you for sharing this.

Dearest Wanda,
Thank you for sharing lessons from your life journey with the Lord. There is something about your openness that
touches me.
Blessings in Christ...Susan

Sharon (2011-10-18 22:47:20)
Wanda, this was an amazing post. God has certainly pushed me out of my comfort zone in the last few months, and
so I can totally relate to what you’re saying.
One of the farewells that I’ve had to say lately actually happened several years ago - and yet, it’s been hard again.
That would be letting go of my adult sons. It’s been so hard lately watching them work out their own lives, watching
them grapple with their own struggles, watching God write their faith stories. Yes, I’m still there for support and
advice - but so often I have been unable to help any more than to pray.
But God reassures me that He is moving us all forward, into something better that we would never see if we stayed
*stuck* -
Thanks for this word of encouragement today.
GOD BLESS!

wisdomvirtueandrubies (2011-10-18 22:52:53)
I’ve always said you remind me so much of myself in so many ways. This post is additional evidence of that. I pray

Ella (2011-10-19 04:41:17)

Wanda,
As I read your post, I was reminded of how God is all about ”new”. He re-creates us into new creations, and is
ever before us doing a ”new thing”, so that we might sing a ”new song”. Goodbyes are hard, but your words have
encouraged my heart to embrace the new thing God is ever opening before me.
Beautiful words. Thank you, too, for stopping by my blog today and leaving such beautiful words behind.

**Think Before You Speak (2011-10-19 06:00)**

[1] Which of you havent wished to recant your words at one time or another? I
know I have on many occasions even though I consider myself to be quieter than most. Im still guilty of
using my words as arsenals rather than agents of healing far too many occasions. While reading a devotional
from Bible Gateway the other day, I came across a great acronym to use before speaking ( I know the trick
is to actually put into practice). The next time we get the urge to speak, it would be wise to ask ourselves
the following:

```
T Is it true?
H Is it helpful?
I Is it inspiring?
```

```
N Is it necessary?
```

```
K Is it kind?
```

Read the entire devotional over at [2]Girlfriends in God.

**Beyond (2011-10-21 07:15)**

Beyond is moving pass the often self-imposed limitations.
beyond the shame forgetting the pain of the past
No longer clinging to whats gone but embracing what remains
all the while understanding theres more to attain

Moving out of places of comfort to new canvases
allowing myself to paint with new colors
and trusting that even with these hues beauty can be seen.

Beyond the chains of my own thoughts
but grasping for higher & more loftier ones.

Refusing to be chained to the failures of yesterday
I choose to move beyond what I thought relinquishing my own hopes
so that I might received beyond what I could imagine.

Joining [1]Gypsy Mama for 5-minute Friday. When I saw the word beyond, it reminded me of the song thats
been playing for days on my car stereo. Sharing it with you.

This really stuck out to me: ”Refusing to be chained to the failures of yesterday

so that I might received beyond what I could imagine.”
May we all move beyond whatever point we are to really know Him more deeply so that we’ll be more of who He
wants us to be.
Love you.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-10-22 06:47:56)
Wanda, you are using one of my favorite words in Scripture: remains. I met with a friend who lost her disabled
daughter years ago, after years of struggle. As I sat with her last night the thought came to me that she no longer
looks as if she is about to cry 24/7. She no longer looks crippled emotionally. What remains is being restored and
rebuilt. For once, there was no tears, but laughter. There was a time that she was walking dead, but now there is
strength to continue on fully alive to see and press on beyond. I was encouraged in ways I can’t even describe. I am
encouraged by this blog to walk fully alive.
”...you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up! Strengthen what remains...” - Revelations 3:1-2

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2011-10-22 15:11:02)
”Beyond the chains of my own thoughts,” and ”Refusing to be chained to the failures of yesterday”–yes, that is what
keeps me down. Keeps me from moving forward. Always caught in the ”what ifs” of yesterday and the whirrings of
my own thoughts.
Moving forward means letting go and trusting God–really believing Him.
Thank you for this thought-filled post, Wanda. So glad to have you visit Sharon’s and my IRL meeting. It was
sublime!
Blessings,
Janis

Just reading this today. Oddly enough, today I’ve been struggling to move beyond some past relational mistakes and
embrace with wisdom the promises of today and the future. Trying not to get stuck asking ”why”. God’s timing is
perfect. This post blessed me today.

Sharon (2011-10-24 12:52:39)
Wanda, this was beautiful - just like your heart.
This was the part that I absolutely loved:
”Moving out of places of comfort to new canvases allowing myself to paint with new colors and trusting that even with
these hues beauty can be seen.”
As long as I place my whole life into the hand of the Almighty, I can rest assured that the Master Painter will create
a thing of beauty.
”For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for
us long ago.” (Ephesians 2:10, NLT)
Don’t you just love that?! :)
GOD BLESS!

## 2.11 November

**The Road Back to Judah (2011-11-01 11:38)**

Have you ever found yourself in a place in life that was absent of judah (praise)? While if we just think
and examine close enough there is always something for which to be grateful. But life can throw you some
blows that shroud the goodness around you. The book of Ruth tells of the story of one such woman, named

Naomi. [1]
In an attempt to avoid famine in her hometown, Naomi travelled with her husband and sons to Moab. During
her time there she lost her husband and eventually her two sons. Left widowed, alone, and hopeless in a
foreign land. Yet she heard the news of God blessing in her hometown and made the decision to go back
home.
Although she was going back to a place she had been before, she wasnt the same. Her condition had changed.
She went out married and came back widowed. She went out with children and came back childless. She left
full of hope but was returning hopeless. She was coming back bitter, full of sorrow, and blaming God for her
plight.
Like Naomi, I have encountered changes during my life journey. Changes that were for the worse instead of
better. Changes that led me back to square one again. Only this time my heart wasnt as open as before. I
wasnt as hopeful as before. I wasnt rehearsing His goodness as before. Why? Because I thought I heard
God but it didnt turn out the way I expected. Or because I experienced loss or disappointment.

Each of our lives have episodes of loss, disappointment, grief, bad decision-making but our stories dont have
to end there. All the while Naomi was going about trying to survive, God was orchestrating a plan. He was
ushering her back to a place in life, one that she couldnt even conceive in her own mind, that was leading
to hope and praise. And Hes doing that for you and me. All the times I cried about loss, I didnt readily
see that He would bring new experiences, which would lead me back to hope, faith, and love again.

God is one who is in the details of our lives. He is in the midst of our everyday affairs and He can make
sense of all the randomness.

You expressed very well the disappointments that we go through...I am happy that you have hope back.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-11-01 13:21:06)
All I’ll say here is, ”Yes, Lord, Yes”. I am say yes to God still, even if I don’t know which way is up, even if it feels as
if I have not advanced one step this whole year, even if I have had more disappointments than I can count. I am say
Yes because I absolutely refuse to turn back.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-11-01 18:08:12)
Very well written Wanda, I am pleased you feel you have hope.
Take care.
Yvonne.

Sharon (2011-11-01 20:03:21)
Just absolutely beautiful.
This was my favorite thought:
”God is one who is in the details of our lives. He is in the midst of our everyday affairs and He can make sense of all
the randomness.”
Yes, there is no such thing as ”random” or ”chaotic” or ”unintended” in the life of a Christ follower. God has every
thread firmly in His hand, and He faithfully weaves them into a beautiful tapestry that reflects His image.
It’s so much better if we let Him control the pattern from the very beginning - there’s a lot less to tear out and do
over!!
I love the story of Naomi and Ruth - I just posted something about it on Sunday. Such a testimony of God’s hand on
a life, directing it behind the scenes, to HIS perfect ending.
Thanks for sharing, Wanda.
GOD BLESS!

Lisa (2011-11-02 00:28:24)

Naomi was going about trying to survive, God was orchestrating a plan.” Amen!

Deidra (2011-11-02 01:19:41)
Oh, I see myself here. Faced with disappointment, I kick at the dirt and stir up a whirlwind of whining. Not pretty.
Sometimes I forget God is in the wilderness. Thanks for this reminder. :)

Wanda (2011-11-02 11:51:42)
**Deidra**, I’ve done my share of whining as well. **Lisa** you’re right going back is not always a bad thing. Sometimes
during our lives we drift away from God and the things of God and need to go back. **Susie** thank you so much! Oh
so true **Sharon** all that looks random to us is absolutely no surprise to God and its just one of those things He’s
using for our greater good. **Yvonne** thanks! **Bluebutterfly** a continually yes is what we all need. **Kim** life is full
of disappointments of some kind but as long we are here we are not without hope. Thanks to each of you for sharing
your thoughts. Blessings.

**B E L O V E D (2011-11-03 05:35)**

As I opened the latest edition of [1]Sanctified Together, I was greeted with the words beloved Wanda. The
idea of me being BELOVED gripped my thoughts. It was not just some standard opening line but rather I
was reminded that its just what God feels about me. I am His beloved. You are His beloved!

My beloved is mine, and I am his, Song of Solomon 2:16a

**The Promise Keeper (2011-11-07 08:37)**

Its hard to believe we are already in the next to last month of the year.
Where has the time gone? There is something about this time of year that causes me to look back over
the landscape of my year and do an assessment. Although looking for areas of accomplishments is good, I
generally find myself examining the areas that I started but never finished. My eyes focus on what I have
yet to obtain or see manifest in my life. Do you know what happens when I do this? Disappointment sets
in. I lose my grip on the promises of God.
As I walked this morning and pondered yesterdays message in my heart, I heard the whispers of God
reminding me that He is the promise keeper. For a girl, who has experienced the heartache of broken
promises, its hard for me at times to really trust. People I thought were trustworthy proved themselves
otherwise. And then there is the fact that I dont always keep the promises I make to myself. I promise to
eat better, exercise more, venture out more, think better thoughts, or act less selfishly BUT I fail to keep
my word. So the issue of promises often has me mentally squirming and pondering should I really believe
that itll happen this time.

Our vision of God is often distorted because we look through the lens of our human experiences. A promise
is only as good as the character of the one, who makes the promise. As humans, we all have failed to keep
at least one promise but not God.

```
True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they broke their promises, does that
mean God will break his promises? Romans 3:3 NLT
```

Despite the approach of the end of year, do not lose hope in Gods Word. There is still time left. Do as
Psalms 119:82 says, strain to see the promises of God. Daily He is fulfilling promises to you and me.

Tracy (2011-11-07 09:48:38)
Hi Wanda - I was just thinking yesterday how God is the ONLY one you can trust. I asked God once, ”why Lord,
why wasn’t he trustworthy.” And the answer that came back was - ”you were trusting him and not ME! ouch
Great post Wanda
God bless

Wanda, as I read your words I was reminded that to Him, to our Creator, there is no end. Even when we fall and fail
and reach our end, we have Him. Even when we can’t trust ourselves, we can trust Him. He will carry us through.
Great is our Lord and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit. - Psalm 147:5
He made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He keeps every promise forever. - Psalm 146:6
The Lord always keeps His promises. - Psalm 145:13

Ooh! I love this post Wanda, as recently my Pastor preached on Promises and it made me think of the promises I
had made to others and not always kept. I then pondered on the many, many promises, of God that I do not always
stand on, despite KNOWING that God never breaks His promises.
Thank you for reminding us to strain to see the promises of God’.
I noticed you popped into [1]The Faith Lounge recently. Thank you for joining in the conversation. Look out for my
next post about the four words that changed my walk with the Lord, it will help you in ANY challenge.

Monica Watkins (2011-11-19 14:49:06)
As with most of your posts, I can certainly relate to the thoughts and feelings you’ve expressed in this post. For years,
I would spend the end of the year reflecting on the promises I hoped would come to pass with the dawn of a new year.
Just as you said, disappointment would set in quickly. I’ve learned that God’s promises are true and His timing is
perfect. I haven’t started my reflections of this year, yet, but I pray I will keep the truth you’ve shared here in mind
when I do.

**Because Just One is Never Enough (2011-11-09 08:01)**

[1] Have you ever just ate one M &M or one potato chip? I cant
think of one single time thats occurred for me. Its just something about them that calls me back for another
one. And then another one. Even when I tried these new popcorn chips, which I didnt like, I gave it more
than one try. For you, it might not be either of two that has you reaching for more. But there is bound to
be something that you refuse to settle for just one.

If food, clothes, shoes, or technological gadgets can have us (me) craving for more than one, why is it that
we (me) settle for acknowledging God on a matter just once? Ouch, is what I said when this was brought to
my attention today. The other day a friend of mine told me that I think too much. Admittedly, I consider
myself more of a thinker than a talker but I was prodded by the spirit that the reason for some of all that
thinking is that Im not doing enough acknowledging in my life. You see when Im thinking, I am pondering
ways to fix this, correct that, and predict the future. In essence Im taking matters into my own feeble hands.
The thinking gets me super glued to what-if(s) and how.

When all I really need to do is trust and put into practice Proverbs 3:6,

```
In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. (NKJV)
```

Its not enough to acknowledge God once but its something to be done continually. He does not become
tired of us coming to Him about the details of our life. He promised to give us direction. If Im feeling lost,
perhaps it is because I have failed to seek His counsel. So even if you asked God once and you did not hear
anything (because that happens to me a lot), remain consist in your acknowledging.

Tracy (2011-11-09 12:24:01)
Hi Wanda - I love how you say we need to continuously acknowledge God in all our ways. So true. Like His mercies
are new every day, our acknowledgement of Him should be daily, hourly if need be, too
Great post and thank you for linking up. I look forward to seeing you there.
God bless

Sharon (2011-11-09 15:15:08)
Oh Wanda - have you crawled up inside my head?!
This was such a good post. Painfully true for me, but also wonderfully inspiring. This was the line that really stopped
me:
”In essence Im taking matters into my own feeble hands. The thinking gets me super glued to what-if(s) and how.”
I also am an interesting mix of very deep feelings and a very analytical mind. The way I try to ”break down” life is
so very exhausting.
Acknowledging Him - so simple, yet so hard to remember to put into practice. Forgive us (me) Lord, for failing to
remember that when we acknowledge You - You promise to direct our paths.
GOD BLESS!

**Who Said You Were Exempt (2011-11-14 07:09)**

Can anyone say with honesty that they welcome trouble? I certainly can not. For trouble is an equal
opportunist. It cuts across all cultures, socioeconomic statuses, and races. Money cant shoo all trouble
away. And even our profession of faith as Christ followers does not give us an all-exclusive pass from trouble.

Ezekiel serves as a prime example that you can be doing all the right things and still bad things happen. He
was serving God, proclaiming His truths, yet he still received troubling news.

```
Son of man, with one blow I will take away your dearest treasure. Yet you must not show
any sorrow at her death. Do not weep; let there be no tears. Groan silently, but let there be
no wailing at her grave. Do not uncover your head or take off your sandals. Do not perform
the usual rituals of mourning or accept any food brought to you by consoling friends. Ezekiel
24:16-17
```

Now putting myself in Ezekiels shoes, I wonder what my true response would be. Would I be tempted to
whine about how unfair it all seemed? Would I continue to proclaim His truth despite my personal situation?
I do not have to look back very far to see how I have failed similar tests. Unlike Ezekiel, I havent experienced
the loss of a spouse but I have lost things as a believer. And I must say there have been times that I was a
very sore loser. My commitment level waned. My confessions of certain truths were less than normal. But
that was not the case with Ezekiel, instead he proclaimed to the people the next morning, and in the evening
his wife died but he still did everything God said.
Reading further in the passage, you will find that God was using him as a example for the people so that
they might know that God is the sovereign Lord. Granted Ezekiel had the privilege of knowing before hand
that this trouble was coming, which we dont always have. But in the Word it tells us that in this life we
will have trouble. Can God trust us (me) to be a proper reflection of Him even during troubling times? Will
we (I) remain steadfast in our obedience, love, confession and serving?

```
BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-11-14 08:35:37)
Wanda, all weekend I’ve been focused on the concept of ”sharing in the sufferings”. We love the gifts and the benefits,
but no one likes the suffering. I have yet to meet anyone who likes pain.
```

Thanks for the reminder that how we respond to suffering, to trouble, matters.
Thanking God for His comfort and presence in trouble.
We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. -
2 Corinthians 4:10
For as we share abundantly in Christs sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. - 2 Corinthi-
ans 1:5

Tracy (2011-11-14 09:45:53)
Hi Wanda - very deep thoughts today. I don’t think my behaviour at loss has been a very good example but I think
even in those times God uses our responses good or bad to guide us. You have challenged me to go read Ezekiel.
Great post
God bless

You are always thought provoking!xXx

Denise (2011-11-15 04:36:30)
Hard to remember sometimes that despite our heartbreak and the brokenness of our past (or how many pieces we
have been broken into!), God can put us back together and use us as an example of the completeness that we find in
Him and Him alone.
Great post!
Blessings and hugs,

Wanda (2011-11-15 06:28:41)
**Bluebutterfly**, you’re so right. We do love to be partakers of the goodness but some how forget being in fellowship
with Him in suffering as well. **Tracy** I just couldn’t shake that passage of scripture. **Susie** thank you. It’s a challeng-
ing book but some good lessons to glean from. **Ella**Indeed it is a challenge. **Denise**love your statement...no matter
how many pieces. Yes the potter can take the pieces and use us.

Sharon (2011-11-17 16:25:17)
I’m sorry to say that I would whine - how do I know this? Because I already do it in my own life now. Why do we
have so much trouble understanding that in this life we WILL have troubles. And yet, we are to count them joy -
because somehow they tie us even closer to our Lord and Savior.
Great word today, Wanda - you have me pondering.

I have to be willing to know Him in the good times and in the bad!

**Grow (2011-11-18 07:13)**

Babies, plants, animals. Each of them are things that [1]grow. No matter what our age there is always room
to grow. Growing can be uncomfortable. Stretching you beyond places of comfort. Expanding your mind.
Embracing new ideas. Willingness to try new things. Each of those are required to produce [2]growth. One
has to be connected to the source of life in order to produce much lasting fruit. Otherwise, the winds of life
easily topple those outward growths. If you are not seeing enough growth above perhaps its best to check
the roots beneath. Are you fully anchored in the true sustenance of life?

**It****s Not About Me (2011-11-21 08:03)**

```
But let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know Me,
that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I
delight, declares the LORD. Jeremiah 9:24
```

Pedigrees

titles

possessions

achievements

blog stats

are things that can be used by some to define success. The more letters behind ones name and the more
toys one can accumulate can often lead one to be revered by others. And if we are not careful, we will become
awestruck with ourselves. Surely you have seen those who are in awe of themselves. Their conversations are
chocked with I statements.

But as believers we are called to higher level of boasting. Not in the knowledge weve acquired, or the brute
of force we can mange, nor in our money are we to call attention. But rather our boasting is to be that we
know God. That we have relationship with God. If any man had room to brag on himself it was Paul but
even he said:

```
Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ
Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that
I could gain Christ. Philippians 3:8 (NLT
```

While its perfectly understandable to be proud of ones accomplishments, we must not lose sight of the fact
that it wasnt our wisdom, strength, smarts, willpower alone that got us there.

So thankful for this word today. I have declined all invitations for thanksgiving this year. I’ve gotten tired of people

I’m not sitting through that this year. I intend to keep my focus above.

This the ultimate, the most important truth. We can be boosted up in the eyes of men and just as quickly be torn
down by those same people who elevated us. We should be consistent in our love for God because he is consistent in
his love for us. He has allowed us to be where we are and we need to recognize that.

**How Content Are You? (2011-11-28 07:32)**

Am I really content? Thats the question thats loitering in my head this morning as I rewind yesterdays
message in my mind. Can I really say as Paul said in Philippians 4: 11-13 that I have learned the secret of
being content?

```
11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith
to be content. 12 I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and
in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need
```

. 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (KJV)
11 And I am not saying this because I feel neglected, for I have learned to be satisfied with
what I have. 12 I know what it is to be in need and what it is to have more than enough. I have
learned this secret, so that anywhere, at any time, I am content, whether I am full or hungry,

```
whether I have too much or too little. 13 I have the strength to face all conditions by the power
that Christ gives me. (GNT)
```

It would be easy to blast off a quick yes Im happy with what I have but closer inspection of the word
contentment is necessary. According to the Holman Bible Dictionary, contentment is an internal satisfaction
which does not demand changes in external circumstances. The American Heritage Dictionary defines content
has desiring no more than what has or satisfied; ready to accept or acquiesce; willing.

In examining those two definitions, I can easily see that I dont fully measure up to Pauls declaration. I can
think of situations I dont readily accept. Nelsons Illustrated Dictionary defines content as freedom from
anxiety or worry.

```
The idea of of contentment comes from a Greek word that means independence or self-
sufficiency. But the apostle Paul used the word in a Christian sense to show that real satisfaction
or sufficiency comes from God:
```

Quite frankly there are some conditions I find myself in that I become irritated and anxiously await change
to come. So how does one be content yet expectantly wait for fulfillment of the promises? Hmmm, a quick
search of my blog archives reveal this has not been the first time I have pondered the question. In a post
titled [1]Satisfaction Guaranteed, I stated the following:

```
How can I be satisfied when I don’t like what is occurring around me? Honestly, I haven’t
mastered the art of contentment. But in reading something the other day, I gained greater insight
on contentment. When I know and trust that where I am is not outside of God’s radar, I can be
confident that He is orchestrating all things and that there is indeed a plan for my life. Therefore,
I can patiently wait on Him.

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-11-28 08:42:21)
I’m ponder too, Wanda. My big battle this year has been to be ”truly” content, and I can honestly say that I am not
there yet.
```

```
Kim @ Stuff could... (2011-11-28 09:03:27)
I immediately said Yes I am content...but you ponder it deeper which is food for thought...I will strive to keep content
from day to day.
```

```
Jessica (2011-11-28 09:13:28)
With many changes God is making in my life, this is a wonderful reminder of being content...genuinely content. Thank
you and blessings!

Great food for thought, Wanda! I can say that I am constantly aware and working on this, but don’t always succeed!

Tracy (2011-11-28 13:25:29)
Hi Wanda - my mother-in-law reckons her gift is the gift of contentment and if you think about it, it is truly a gift,
to be content in all things. Great post
God bless
Tracy
```

Lisa (2011-11-28 15:38:58)
I know I haven’t mastered contentment. Too often I find myself wanting more. But I am reminded that God’s grace
is sufficient and more than enough. So I’m learning to count my blessings and wait on Him.
Many blessings, Wanda!

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-11-28 16:32:07)
I won’t be fully content until my son and grandchildren are back in the fold again.
Yvonne.

Wanda (2011-11-28 17:59:32)
I haven’t mastered it either but reading Paul’s words lets me know that it is possible to obtain contentment in this
life. I do believe some people are gifted more with the ability to be content. May we each grab a hold to the secret.

Denise (2011-11-29 05:08:57)
Oh Wanda; great post! Can I say that I’m content in any circumstance; that I’m completely satisfied in any situation?
I have always though that I am content, but this makes me think much deeper. When I stop depending on myself,
and turn to God to get me through any situation, then I can have faith and be content that God is in control of
everything, and that everything is for His own Holy purpose and my good will.
I will be pondering on this all day! :)
Blessings and hugs,
Denise

Ella (2011-11-29 23:07:44)
I have moments, but a lot of unsettled thoughts, too! Wow, this one I need to think about more
Interesting post :D

Peggy (2011-12-04 13:43:20)
Blessings Wanda,
This was probably the one I was suppose to read... and I’d love to ponder and dig into but I’m off to Spanish speaking
church... content?
Hmmmmmmmmm ...guess I’m working on it in all circumstances but content for right now in who I am and who I
am becoming in Christ Jesus! I’ll have to soak in Philippians and your blog post another time.
Have a blessed SONday!
Peggy

**Did The Den Do You In? (2011-11-30 06:29)**

[1] Having faith does not prevent you from descending into the
pits of life. Instead, faith gives you the ability to remain steadfast as you go through the those pit experiences.
People today are still asking the same question King Darius did in Daniel 6:20.

```
Wanda (insert your name), servant of the living God! Was (is) your God, whom you serve so
faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?
```

Unlike Daniel I have not been thrown into a physical den of lions. But havent we all encountered lions of
our own. Being thrown into a lions den was not meant to be a leisurely stroll at the school. It was designed
to destroy and to kill Daniel. His adversaries had no expectation of him surviving the experience. What is
your lion?What occurred in your life that was poised to tear you and leave you for dead? Some things are
sent to destroy your witness, your faith, your character, your marriage, your relationships, your body, your
hope, your health, or your mobility.

And you can rest assured that someone is watching to see if you will come out of it alive. But as I pondered
over Daniels date with the lions den, I noticed that not only did he come out of it but he came out without
scars. Can we say we came out of the trial without scars? If the enemy cant stop you from coming out,
he will aim to keep you scarred for life. The evidence of scarring shows when we refuse to try again, trust
again, love again, hope again, or pursue again.

Dear God, I thank you and I declare that you are mighty! Not only are you mighty enough to bring us out
but you are able to make us whole again. Make us whole in our inner man, in our emotions, in our love for
one another. We dont want to be limited by our pit experiences. May you get the glory out of our lives. In
Jesus name. Amen.

Pam (2011-11-30 07:57:20)
Once again, food for thought. I get so much from your ability to take one small passage of Scripture and challenge us
with your insights into it, Wanda. This one made me do some reflecting which in turn revealed to me time and time
again when God has brought me through without scars.
Thank you, my friend!
Pam

Renee (2011-11-30 10:07:50)
Love this post! I want to come out of the den victorious. Thanks for inspiring me. Blessings!

Oh, amen, Wanda! Praying that prayer of victory with you....

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-11-30 10:12:59)
Lord, I too thank you for making me whole again, to love again, to pursue again, and to keep getting up again and
again.

welcome to my world of poetry (2011-11-30 13:56:02)
A wonderful post Wanda and soul searching.
Yvonne.

Lisa (2011-11-30 13:59:09)
Amen! We can come out of the pit without scars. And if we are already scarred, God can deliver us and make us
whole again. Wonderful encouragement!

Angel @ Finding The Inspiring (2011-11-30 15:51:03)
Praise God all his good gifts! Yes, He is mighty. Thank you for this great reminder than God can deliver and redeem
us. Amen!

Nungari M. (2011-12-01 00:03:24)
Thanks Wanda for finding me and helping me find you. You know...this is what I needed to hear this morning. I have
been in the den a few times, to the point of serious depression. Out I am, but the scars-that is what I need to deal
with, to trust, to hope again, to move on and to truly believe God that, that season is gone. Thanks my dear..thanks..
I know God wants to deal with my scars....

Janis@Open My Ears Lord (2011-12-01 01:15:22)
Wanda, this was great. We don’t want scars coming out of the pit. Things that leave us unable to love or trust. We
may have survived but we won’t thrive and give life to others. I’ve seen that happen in my own life.
Thank you for some great words of wisdom.
Blessings,
Janis

Peggy (2011-12-04 13:39:54)
Amen! WOW Wanda!
This one is powerful! I wish we had ”lions” like that one asleep but we all know that
our ”enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
I’m so glad I did take time to come and read this one, ”the lion drew me here” but not the one that devours, the Great
Lion of Judah!
I saw the photo of the lion, and I thought and began singing (and mind you it’s Sun. in the middle of 2 church
services) ”in the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight”

```
quickly followed by the one by Jason Upton [1]”Lion of Judah” and the strength in the song by Paul Wilbur
that I love so much [2]Lion of Judah ... You have to fill your mind with Godly songs when the others you enjoyed in
the past creep in...
I so love what you wrote in your final paragraph before the prayer about scars. Our Lord Jesus has nail print scars
in His precious hands and feet and His side lanced. This is so beautifully written:
”The evidence of scarring shows when we refuse to try again, trust again, love again, hope again, or pursue again.”
Thank you, this one too speaks loudly to me and strengthens me for the battles! Bless you Wanda!
So thankful I’m not limited by my pit experiences! THE LION OF JUDAH is MIGHTY INDEED! I think I’ll go put
on my Lion t-shirt and let Him roar!
Peggy

Hi Wanda - this is a great post. i always look at Daniel’s den from the perspective of those who got thrown in after.
But God’s might is definitely the headline here. Excellent. Great encouragement. I want to thank you too for linking
up with me. i appreciate it and look forward to seeing you again this week. You are a great woman of God, Wanda.
thanks for the encouragement

## 2.12 December

**Voice Activated (2011-12-02 06:23)**

Go any where there are people gathered and you are bound to hear chatter. Some discussing the latest
gossip, others dialoguing about current events, and some sharing the details of their home life. [1]Talk,
chatter, babble, words are all around us. We cant escape them. We need them to engage in our world. So
much of what is uttered in the course of our day is spoken with a second thought. But today Im reminded
to use my voice to stimulate others.

```
Dont be afraid, he said, for you are very precious to God. Peace! Be encouraged! Be strong!
As he spoke these words to me, I suddenly felt stronger and said to him, Please speak to me, my
lord, for you have strengthened me. Daniel 10:19 (NLT)
```

Although Daniel was being spoken to by an angelic being, each of us have the power to [2]speak words of
encouragement to others. You never now how much someone needs to hear a kind word. We dont know all
the details of one another lives but we can be assured that we all go through things that sap our strength or
causes us to be afraid at times.
Having entered into the last month of the year, one is likely to feel not as invigorated as they were in the
beginning of the year. But it doesnt have to end that way. Despite all 2011 has brought into(or out of) your
life, dont lose sight of the fact that You, my friend, are precious to God.
I speak peace to you.
Be encouraged!
God has not [3]abandoned you.
Be strong!

What are you activating in the lives of others when you speak? When you write? Its my prayer that
the words you find here activate faith, strength, courage, and love. I count it a blessing to be among the
community of bloggers here. You may never know how much your words, even though I have never heard
your lovely voices, have fortified my steps along this journey.

I had the chance this week to speak to a group of young moms. It was quite humbling and joyous to be given the
opportunity to speak the Lord’s words to others. I pray that He forms and shapes my thoughts and feelings as I seek

I’m taking your very timely words of encouragement, and I’m putting them in my spiritual backpack as I head out to
tell the world more about the GOOD NEWS of Jesus!
GOD BLESS!

more that I want to view and read!
Thank you for this! May we all be encouraged and speak forth words like Daniel and this wonderful word from you! I
thought perhaps you were doing a study on Daniel! May God love on you today and this week in a very special way!

Teaser Tuesdays is a weekly bookish meme, hosted by MizB of Should Be Reading. Anyone can play along!
Just do the following:

Grab your current read
Open to a random page

Share two (2) teaser sentences from somewhere on that page
BE CAREFUL NOT TO INCLUDE SPOILERS! (make sure that what you share doesnt give too much
away! You dont want to ruin the book for others!)
Share the title and author, too, so that other TT participants can add the book to their TBR Lists if they
like your teasers!

I don’t even know why, but I am going through the Book of Jeremiah in December. When everything in Jeremiah
told him to pack it up and go home because no one would give one hoot about what he had to say, he chose to obey
God and speak (but only what God told him).

Brenda Kay Ledford (2011-12-06 14:24:54)
Wanda,
I just found your blog and I love it. The words are so uplifting. I’m so glad to find another Christian.
I am reading from the book of Job now. I was in the dentist’s office this morning and was blessed by the words from
Job where a cut down tree will spring forth with life again. Those are powerful words for the hard times we are all
facing now.

Bluebutterfly, I too found Jeremiah’s determination inspiring when I read through that book of the Bible. I’m cur-
rently reading in Hosea and his commitment inspires me as well.
Hi Brenda, glad to have you stop over for a visit. That is a powerful statement from Job. It reminds me that with
God all hope is never lost. Even when things appear dead, God has the ability to resurrect it.
Yvonne, always a pleasure to have drop by my friend.
Alida, I have seen that book mentioned elsewhere. I’d love to hear how you like the book.
I understand Kim. My reading time varies depending upon what’s going on in my life. Recently I took the time to
finish up some books I had started some time ago.

**Color (2011-12-09 06:49)**

[1]
In a world filled with darkness. He sent a light to shine.
The world doused in crimson. Yet only his red blood could make us white again.
He created the many colors of the universe but yet through colorless eyes He sees us all.
He welcomes each of us with loving arms and mounds of grace and mercy.
No longer do we have to hide behind the stains of red sin, the blue of depression, or the green of envy.
There is a cleanser for every color that tries to shield us from His light.

Growing up in church the Bible has been a part of my life since my very beginning. I remember read your
Bible was often retorted by my mom for any boredom expressed by me or my siblings. Needless to say as

kids that was the last thing on our minds. Even after accepting Christ as my personal savior, the Bible was
often not my book of choice. Much of it seemed to make little sense to me and I couldnt understand how
to incorporate into my daily life. But thankfully that has changed.
As an attendee of an Pentecostal church, the KJV was the translation of choice we read. Over the years, I
have added several other translations of the Bible to my library. I find that at different times in my life, I
read more from certain translations. Currently I have been reading a lot from the New Living Translation
and I love how the Message translate some passages. Each of them add deeper insight into a passage of
scripture. While KJV will always be good starting point for me, I appreciate the opportunity to read verses
in different translations. Thats why I was pleased to have the opportunity to be a part of the Common

English Bible (CEB), Thank You-Come Again I Promise blog tour. [1]
Over the next several weeks, I will be exploring more of the Common English Bible and sharing passages
of scripture with you. As a part of the tour, my readers have the opportunity to win a copy of the soft-
cover edition each week. For more information about the Common English Bible visit their website at
[2]http://www.commonenglishbible.com
To win simply fill out the form below or leave a comment. Winner will be selected Friday, December 16th.
Disclosure: As a participate in the blog tour I was given a complimentary copy of the Deco Tone edition of
the Common English Bible.Any views or opinions expressed are my own.

I remember that song from Sunday School.
The B-I-B-L-E. Yes, that’s the book for me.
I am like you, Wanda - over the years, especially in the last few years, I have grown to LOVE my Bible. It has become
my friend. I also enjoy the NLT - it reads to me like a story.
God speaks powerfully to me through His Word. I’ll be interested in checking out this translation that I’m not familiar
with. Thanks for sharing.
GOD BLESS!

Carole in the UK (2011-12-11 18:20:30)
I loved your post Wanda, it made me chuckle, as I remember when we were bored as childen, my Mum would also
retort to us, ”Read your Bible!”
I read several versions. NLT is the one I read, as my study Bible. I have a tiny NIV for my handbag, which I carry
around with me. However the KJV is my favourite, as that is the one I was brought up with and I always like to read
the Psalms in that version.
I often thank God for the fact that I have access to so many Bibles and I am able to read them freely without any
persecution.
I look forward to your post on the CEB, as my Pastor has started to use this Bible too.

Have a blessed and fruiful week for the kingdom, Wanda

Hi Wanda, I grew up using the KJV Bible also. Most of the scriptures I’ve memorized over the years are from that
version. When I’m studying I refer to other versions but if I’m just spending time reading the word it’s still KJV:)

**Get Your Aim Right (2011-12-12 00:30)**

Have you ever played darts before? I am not sure why, but that was never a game played at my house. The
closest thing Ive done to playing darts is trying to pop a balloon with a dart at a carnival game. And sad
to say, I was not very good at it. Although I clearly saw what my intended target was, I never was able to
direct the dart properly. Several times I came close but close doesnt count.

[1] Just like those darts, I have had my faith shot in the wrong direction many
times. On occasions my faith has been entrusted in my own abilities, knowledge, or wisdom. At other times
my faith was carelessly put on other people or quite frankly my actions revealed that my real trust was in
things. Now of course that was not always instantly visible to me. But it was true. My faith was cast every
where except where it needed to be. From time to time it does us all good to evaluate our faith.

Reflecting on Sundays message, Im determined to properly focus my faith this week, which requires proper
aim. To aim, I need the following:

• A-awareness: I need to be aware of all the many places in which its possible to place my faith.
• I-information: I need to get knowledge about the who or what I have chosen to place my faith. Is it
a trustworthy source? Foremost we have to be aware of the truth that each of us have faith. Romans
12:3b, Instead be reasonable since God has measured out a portion of faith to each one of you. (Common
English Bible)
• M-move: If your faith has been misplaced move it to the proper place. Having faith requires coordinat-
ing action. James 2:17-18 says, In the same way, faith is dead when it doesnt result in faithful activity.
Someone might claim,  You have faith and I have action.  But how can I see your faith apart from
your actions? Instead, Ill show you my faith by putting it into practice in faithful action. (Common
English Bible)

Is your faith aimed correctly? If not, there is no time like the present to readjust it. [2]

We often had dart boards in our house when I was a teenager and on. And there were holes in the wall all around
where the dart boards were placed. There was a lot of bad aiming going on.
Of late my aim has been wavering. I frequently get distracted by worldly concerns and my faith gets shaken.

**It Takes the Stinky Stuff (2011-12-14 06:45)**

[1]

```
And he told this parable: ”A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking
fruit on it and found none. And he said to the vinedresser, ’Look, for three years now I have come
seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?’
And he answered him, ’Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.
Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’” (ESV)
Luke 13:6-9
```

Jesus gives a parable about a fig tree in which an owner had been expecting fruit from it for three years.
Exacerbated by the lack of fruit after all this time, he orders the vine to be destroyed. As I read several
translations of this passage, I was reminded that it often takes the manure of life to produce real growth in
us. As long as we reside in places of familiar comfort to us, we just exist. Producing little for the kingdom.
We pray little, confess little, give little, study little, focus little, aim for little. But when trouble hit, it has
a way of stirring up our prayer lives, driving us to fasting, compelling us to study, and it realigns our focus
on things that truly matter in our lives.
Each of us have been allotted a time here on the earth. And how are we making use of our time? Are we
just using up the ground? I dont want to be guilty of fruitlessness. I dont want God to grow weary of me
just sitting around doing nothing. However, we should be cautious about busyness. Busy schedules are not
an adequate measuring stick for fruitfulness.
The vinedresser requested more time in order to do two things.

1. Dig
2. Dung
Digging requires effort and it cuts into something that was hard or solidified and breaks into smaller parts. It
separates things. For God to dig us out of those familiar places weve settled is uncomfortable. Its irritating.
Dung (manure) stinks. Who wants to endure being broken and being surrounded by smelling situations?
Dont be disheartened if you find yourself encircled by dung during these days. Dont even become dis-
combobulated by the un-comfortableness of the things being broken down or detached from you. It all has
purposegrowth.

**Treasured Thoughts (2011-12-19 06:05)**

Today Im joining Joanne for [1]Monday Manna, which is designed to get together and get to know Gods
Word. Todays verse is Luke 2:19.

```
Mary committed these things to memory and considered them carefully. (CEB)
```

I cant imagine being selected for such a gigantic task as Mary. Even after receiving divine notification
about her miraculous pregnancy and the child she would birth, to receive confirmation from others had to
be encouraging.
At times I have found myself saying that Im like Mary pondering things in my heart. I have had God-
whispered that were far to grand for my feeble mind to comprehend fully but I chose to store them away
for later. And sometimes years later, I have heard a word spoken across a pulpit, directly to me, or read
something that triggered my memory of the promises spoken sometime ago.
I think it does us all well to commit those things weve heard into our minds and to really reflect on them.
In todays information overload, it can be rather easy to read or hear something and just move on to the
next thing. But what happens when we just move onto the next bit of information without cementing it
into our hearts? We lose ground during the normal see nothing days. Having Gods Word stored up gives us
strength to continue on when faced with the challenges of life. What things are you treasuring in your heart
and mind?

A timely word, Wanda. I was speaking to a friend of my, who loves journaling, reading and words as much as I do,
and we talked about the importance of stopping everything to just take in God’s word and let it be written on our
hearts. It’s one thing to hear something or even write it down, but it is quite another to have it embedded in our
hearts forever.
```

Joanne Sher (2011-12-19 14:08:02)
”But what happens when we just move onto the next bit of information without cementing it into our hearts?”
Exactly! And I’m guilty of NOT doing it. Wonderful thoughts, especially for now.

This post really spoke to me today God has been speaking something into my heart that is just too big for me to

it is time for me to do something.
Blessings to you.

Oh so true Bluebutterfly. It’s the meditating that helps embed things into our mind.
Joanne, I thin we all have been guilty of that. I find that it’s the wrong things that I have chosen to cement in my
mind.
Kandi, bless you. Stay attentive to His voice and He’ll lead you to the steps you need to take.
Thank you Denise and Yvonne.

Powerful post, Wanda.
I’ve been treasuring many things in my heart and mind this season. For one thing, I have been really delving into the
humanity of Jesus - what it really looked like, and felt like, to Him. It makes me appreciate him ever more.
And I am also experiencing an overwhelming sense of God’s love for me. What a difference that is making in my life.
Like Mary, there are many things I am pondering in my heart...
Merry CHRISTmas, Wanda - and may GOD BLESS!

Denise (2011-12-22 04:40:26)
Hi Wanda,
Its so important that we commit to total obedience, immerse ourselves in it and apply it to our lives, because the
only way to find peace and rest for our souls is to walk on Gods path and do it His way. :)
Blessings for a joyful Christmas and a New Year of health and happiness!

**Favor Is Not Without Cost (2011-12-22 07:45)**

Like many this time of year, I have been reflecting upon the story of Jesus birth. On Mary in particular.
From Biblical accounts there was nothing special about this young girl in particular. Yet God singled her
out for the greatest assignmentto birth the Savior of the world. On an ordinary day to an ordinary virgin
girl, an extraordinary visitor arrived and interrupted the ordinariness of her life. Luke 1: 28 states the angel
had the following greeting for Mary,

```
Hail thou art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
```

Bakers Evangelical Dictionary defines favor as gaining approval, acceptance, or special benefits or blessings.
I like Merriam-Websters definition as well, defines favor as friendly regard shown toward another especially
by a superior. Some how this ordinary virgin girl had gained approval, acceptance or friendly regard by her
ultimate superior, God. I am amazed at her response to such favor. With only one spoken question, she
faithfully accepts the will of God.
To be favored for such an assignment sounds fascinating but I wonder did Mary fully understand the magni-
tude of her yes to favor. The favor that she didnt even ask for positioned her for threats. The favor of God
threatened her:

• Relationships: Because of what she was carrying, Joseph was preparing to walk away from their
engagement.
• Reputation: The Bible does not go into detail but I can just imagine that the towns people had plenty
to say about this young unmarried girl becoming pregnant. Cant you just hear their whispers and see
those funny glances? If Joseph doubted Marys purity how much more would the neighbors.
• Plans: Before the favor showed up, she and Joseph already had things set in motion for their future
marriage. But the impending birth threaten to bring her planned future to a halt.

As I meditate upon these three areas, I am reminded that Mary was not the only to face such assaults.
Joseph had the favor of God but it lead to strained relationship with his own family members. So much so
that they sold him into slavery. Of course, the favor followed him there as well. His run-in with Potiphars
wife threatened his reputation. And I can just imagine that as he sat in the pit and the prison that his vision
of his life looked as if it would never come into fruition.
To be favored is a blessing but it is not void of cost.
Todays post is from the archives but it still rings true. Im reflecting a lot on Marys story. Wishing you &
yours a Merry Christmas!

Jessica (2011-12-22 14:50:56)
This is SO good and very true! I think that sometimes we can see favor for only the ”blessing” side of it and not the
sacrifices that you mentioned that may (but really inevitably) come with it.
Blessings to you, Wanda and have a very Merry Christmas :)

Blessings Wanda and a blessed and happy New Year to you... I’m so glad that you chose to repost this one and it
caught my eye as I was choosing which post to visit and comment on... because after listening 3 times to a pastor share
on FAVOR since NYE... I decided to do my WFW on FAVOR of GOD and here you are highlighting or reflecting
last weekend on this very topic with some excellent points and insights! So beautifully written and so very, very true!
FAVOR is not without a cost... and you have given two great examples: Mary/Joseph and the OT Joseph! I should
have read this last weekend and linked it to my WFW too! What a blessing you are! Thank you for your visit and
sweet wish! Now I’m curious about the more recent posts as well. May God’s favor not come at such a high cost but
bring blessings to you and those around you! May we grow in wisdom and stature as Jesus did. May whatever we
GO through; GROW us through, so we BREAK through to be more like Him! Thanks Wanda, for blessing my EVE.

Wanda (2012-01-02 07:26:28)

**11 Favorite Posts in 2011 (2011-12-27 09:26)**

The year is quickly coming to a close. As with most years, I find myself looking back in preparation for
launching forward. This year I have decided to revisit the pages of my archives to reread my own writings.
Its interesting to see my life written on pages. Evidence of my struggles throughout the year are splattered
across the pages of my blog. Below are a few of my favorite pieces from the year. They are listed in no
particular order.

1. [1]Headed Out But  Genesis 11:31-32 served as the backdrop for this piece. The verbs: headed,
stopped, settled, lived, & died in this passage of scripture had me reexamining places that I started out in
faith but some how settled else where.
2. [2]Still I Sing  a poem inspired by the song of the birds.
3. [3]I Am  lets us know that whatever I am I can bring to God.
4. [4]Choosing to See Chariots  through a daily devotional in Streams in the Desert a light bulb

moment occurred that showed me I can choose to see test and trials as chariots transporting me from places
of immaturity to maturity, weakness to strength, indifference to compassion, lameness to mobility rather
than boulders crushing me.

5. [5]But What About the Brook  cautioned me not to move ahead of Gods timing. Had Elijah
not waiting until the brook dried up, he quite possible would have missed Gods instruction of going to the
widow woman. Here I had to admit Im often trying to figure out the next steps along the path rather than
just trusting that the Master will direct my footsteps.
6. [6]Mission Complete  challenged me not to stop to early. I Samuel 15 left me wondering how
many times have I, have you, have we called a mission complete prematurely.
7. [7]Everybody Needs a Stripper in Their Life  Our strippers may not be people but perhaps
they are situations like failed marriages, physical/sexual abuse, rejection or disappointments. Regardless
of the form the stripper comes in, its purpose is the same to render you void of hope, dreams, faith, and
identity.
8. [8]Embracing Farewell  discussed the value in saying goodbye. It is the farewells of life that
makes room for new hellos.
9. [9]Beyond  a quick post about looking beyond my limits
10. [10]The Road Back to Judah  Naomi served as the catalyst to help me see how God often or-
chestrates episodes of loss to get us back to places of praise, hope and love.
11. [11]Did The Den Do You In  encouraged me to identify my own lions in life.

Do you ever go back and re-read your own writing? Share a link to one of your own favorite posts

Wanda, I think my favorite, out of the 11 favorites you picked, is number 8 ”Embracing Farewell”. As a United
Methodist pastor’s wife, I have moved a lot. Farewells ARE difficult, BUT the hellos are always such a blessing and,
like you said, opportunities for growth.
Blessings to you!

Dear Wanda,
Since I recently discovered your blog, I look forward to reading what you’ve learned from the Lord this year. What I
love about your blog is that the Lord is exalted.
Blessings in Christ...Susan

BLUEBUTTERFLY (2011-12-28 09:38:58)
Wanda, I have certainly enjoyed your blog. There is always some question that I need to address after readiing it.
Yes, I do go back and read my blog also. I let go of many things and people this year and lost a few who I loved
dearly, so two of my blogs dealing love and goodbye are still very much in my mind.
What If God Simply Tolerated You? (http://swordofgoliath.blogspot.com/2011/02/what-if-god-simply-tol erated-

Wanda (2011-12-29 09:10:35)
**Pam** I have had to struggle with saying goodbye a lot this year. But I’m grateful for the opportunity He entrusted
me with.
**Susan** thank you! Your visits and comments are refreshing.
**Denise** thanks always a pleasure to have you visit.
**Bluebutterfly** it’s amazing that on quite a few occasions this year, we have written on similar topics. I remember
your post about if God only tolerated us. The other one I’ll have to re-read. You always have such good food for
thought.
Thanks**Kim**! I chose those because they really stood out to me due to where I was at the time in my life.
**Barbie**, I’m no poet but amazingly God gave me those words as I fellowshiped with Him during my morning walk.

Bernadine (2011-12-29 17:45:05)
Hello Wanda,
It’s great that you post a list that I could revisit some of your posts I missed.
I love, The Road Back to Judah. It reminded me of a time in my life when God had to lead me back to that place of
praise.

Wanda (2011-12-30 17:19:26)
Hi Bernadine, I can recall my own times of God slowing getting me back to praise.

**Standing on the Crux of Eve (2011-12-30 23:30)**

[1] Here we are nearing the eve of a new year. Every since a few days before
Christmas eve, the word eve has been lodged in my forethoughts. As I thought on Christmas eve, I couldnt
help but wonder if any one could sense something different in the atmosphere. One day the world was still
in the waiting stage, and the next day the wait was overthe Messiah had arrived.

Many people will gather at parties or perhaps church services watching and waiting on New Years eve.
Waiting to see the old depart and welcome the new. The word eve is defined as the evening or day preceding
a special day or the period immediately preceding a certain event. Our calendars help us to easily see the
eve of Christmas and New Years. But there are some eves that cant be easily identified by a calendar. Eves
happen all around us and throughout our lives.

God does not need a specific date to give us an eve. My mind goes back to such individuals as Saul. One
day he was headed out prepared to assassinate Christians not knowing he was on the eve of his deliverance
and start to ministry. On an ordinary day of tending sheep, David was on the eve of being anointed King.
Happily preparing for marriage, Mary had no idea she was on the eve of an unexpected pregnancy. Zachariah
a faithful servant of God, while doing what was customary for priest, was on the eve of having his prayer
answered.

During this time of year, its customary to have our thoughts filled with ideas for new endeavors or old
endeavors that plan to tackle with new fervor. But much of the steam for these projects dies out during
mid-year. However, Im encouraged as I am reminded that Im not limited to a eve on certain times of the
year. With God things are subject to change at any time.

Like most people, there are different things Im trying in this upcoming year. One of which you might have
noticed. I have moved my blog to WordPress (hope I didnt lose any of you in the process of my switch).
And I certainly wish you well any new undertakings but do not lose heart if going into the new year some
things remain the same. Your opportunity for an eve is not limited to December 31st.

Wishing you a Happy & Prosperous New Year!

Joanne Sher (2011-12-31 10:02:35)
What fabulous thoughts, Wanda! And I love the new look :) There are SO many ”eves” that we know nothing about
until after they happen. Will be pondering this for a while.

Wanda, love the new look of your blog!! And no, you didn’t lose me! This was a great post, Wanda. I just absolutely
loved it. There are many unresolved issues on my plate this New Year’s Eve - and I’ve truthfully been a little dis-
couraged by it all - thinking that I’m entering a new year with ”old stuff.” I love your take on God’s ability to give us
*Eves* any time. That gives me such encouragement, such hope. Wishing you a very HAPPY NEW YEAR! I will
look forward to sharing our journeys in 2012! GOD BLESS!

Wanda, Hope you had a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! I have been playing catch up with some blogs this
morning that I missed reading over Christmas. I love and have been inspired by the general theme of things being
written about, to go deeper with God. I think I may have to join in on this challenge and I look forward to reading
the scriptures you will posting. Blessings.

Wanda (2012-01-02 07:42:52)

**A Brand New Beginning, Now What? (2012-01-03 06:23)**

[1] There is just something about the dawn of a new year that has
many people embracing new possibilities. Every year we convince ourselves that some how this year will be
different for us. We will leave behind the past and become the best that we can be. January is a month that
has us feeling hopeful and envisioning all the good things that life may unfold throughout the year. Its a
brand new beginning.

The start of 2012 and my chronological Bible reading plan has me contemplating how to make the most
of our beginnings. As I pointed out in my post titled, [2]On the Crux of Eve, we are not limited to new
beginnings just in January. But whenever we have the opportunity to start anew, how do we really make it
count?

As I read the account of creation, I took notice of the activities that God was engaged in during the beginning
of time.

```
When the earth was without form and void: and darkness was upon the face of the deep. The
spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Genesis 1:2
```

When everything was a blank slate, God got busy moving. He was doing the following:

1. Creating
2. Speaking
3. Ordering

According to Genesis 1:26a, we were created in the image or likeness of God. Which has me thinking that
during my beginnings I should be undertaking these same activities. I have been handed a blank slate and
the question is what will I be creating during the year? Will I let my creative abilities lie dormant? What

words will I be speaking? Life or death? Will I seek to bring order into my life or will allow the chaos of the
world to overwhelm me?

How do you spend the beginning of your year?

Sharon (2012-01-04 14:08:53)
OK, Wanda - being totally hones, I’ve been letting the chaos of life overwhelm me lately. I’m not proud of that - but
it’s the truth. So, your words were very encouraging for me to hear today. And I was particularly challenged by your
words - what will you be speaking, life or death? I have been woefully procrastinating on writing a talk that I know
God is leading me to present to other women. I must choose to live above life - so I can bring words of Life to others...
Thanks for the inspiration today. GOD BLESS!

I want God this year. I desire more of Him, nothing but Him...hopefully we will write on the slate together! That
way God and i can create, speak and order things in my life. Happy 2012!

I was very inspired by your words! I have every desire to be creative- I just need to be lifted up to have the energy to
do so in 2012. Hope someone will lift me up in prayer!
