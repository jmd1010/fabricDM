# Drill Bits Phonics-oriented word lists for teachers

If you’re helping someone learn to read, you’re helping them unlock the connection between the
printed word and the words we speak — the “sound/symbol” connection. This book is a compilation of
lists of words which follow the predictable associations of letters, syllables and words to the sounds we
use in speaking to each other.

This book does not attempt to be a reading program. Recognizing words and patterns in sound/symbol
associations is just one part of reading, though a critical one. This book is designed to be used as a
reference so that you can:

- Meet individual needs of students from a wide range of ages and backgrounds; VAT and TAX may be
more appropriate examples of the short a sound for some students than CAT and FAN, which they may
have memorized without learning the sounds associated with the letters.
- Teach students that exceptions are also predictable, and there are usually many examples of each kind
of exception. These are called special categories or special patterns.

HOW THE LISTS ARE ORGANIZED

Word lists are presented in the order they are taught in many structured, multisensory language
programs:
Syllable type 1: Closed syllables — short vowel sounds (TIN, EX, SPLAT)
Syllable type 2: Vowel consonant-e — long vowel sounds (BAKE, DRIVE, SCRAPE)
Syllable Type 3: Open syllables — long vowel sound (GO, TRI, CU
Syllable Type 4: r-controlled syllables (HARD, PORCH, PERT)
Syllable Type 5: consonant-l-e words (CANDLE, TABLE, MUZZLE)
Syllable Type 6: Vowel pairs — unique sounds (OUT, PAW), long vowel sounds (MAIN, COACH)
Where syllables are broken down into different vowel sounds, easily confused vowels such as e and i are
separated, so that the order of presentation is A-I-O-U-E-Y instead of the alphabetical A-E-I-O-U-Y.
For the first syllable types, there are lists which focus on specific problems students may have, such as
syllables with blends or without beginning consonants. (Not every student needs the skills broken down
into small steps.) As the sound patterns advance, the first lists are still those which do not require the
student to have picked up common patterns which have not been taught.
More comprehensive lists follow, which include other syllable patterns and exceptional patterns such as

-TION and -TURE. In this way, teachers can choose appropriate words to include in an individual
student’s program.
Separate lists address some of the common special categories. Instead of telling students that NATION is
one of so many words which are exceptions because the t in NATION does not make the sound it makes

in TIN, the student can learn there are thousands of words he or she can master by knowing that -TION
often is pronounced SHUN. By learning that TI says SH in many other cases (-TIAL,- TIOUS), even more
words can be unlocked.

This section has word lists for closed syllables. It’s an edited, updated version of the PDF I already
shared.

Syllable type 1: Closed syllables
SHORT A — EASY WORDS Have the student read each word in the word progressions and discover the
connection between changing a consonant and changing the sounds in the word.
An important and often overlooked part of this process is having the student figure out and explain in
his or her own words what is happening when consonants change. The thought processes that he or she
goes through to get beyond intuitively recognizing the effect of the change, to the point of being able to
explain it, help lay the foundations for being able to transfer that knowledge successfully.
At first this may be laborious and its worth questionable, especially if the student is accurately reading.
And, since at this stage of teaching you’re trying to establish trust and successful habits, use your
judgment if the talking-out task is frustrating. However, it’s precisely the connections between action
and language that unlock the reading code for many struggling readers. It's especially those bright kids
with specific language problems (and especially the impulsively fast responders), who learn isolated
skills easily but don’t transfer that skill to reading in context, who most benefit from taking time to think
and talk the process through. Use the second and third groups of words for the student to apply this
knowledge and explain the changes to you. Encourage discovery and review of patterns (that SH makes
one sound with two letters, for example), and discussions of meanings of words. Listen for troublesome
consonants. Are blends much harder than single consonants? Are there some consonants — q, x or y
especially — which are less securely known? If so, practice them! Never assume that a student is picking
up on things — ask. Ask what’s changing from word to word. Asking is better than telling, too — just try
to ask the right question so your student tells you the right answer. If you tell the student an answer, be
sure to ask that question again. SHORT I INCT is not as hard as it looks; ask the student what INC would
sound like (and if there is still hesitation, show INK and then change the k to c), and then add the t at the
end. It also rhymes with WINKED. The hard nonsense syllables may be too frustrating to introduce at
first. There may be students who need a lot of practice with the two sounds of c and g, so a special list is
included. Too often a student has mastered vowel pairs — but still pronounces CENT as KENT.
ABOUT THOSE EXCEPTIONS
 Consider CHR as in CHRIS as a category to be taught as its own mini-lesson and incorporated
into drill and review with the other letter/sound associations. CH is /k/ in many words of Greek
derivation. The longer and more scientific the word, the more likely CH will represent the /k/
sound. CHR is always pronounced /kr/, as in CHRIS, CHRISTINE, CHRISTMAS, CHRYSANTHEMUM
and PULCHRITUDE.
 Especially with younger students, it can help to give letters “personalities.” “Bossy Ls that
change the vowels” can be easier to remember than “the consonant which tends to change the
vowel sound right before it.”
 SHORT O There are several groups of o syllables that end in consonants, but have a long vowel
sound (-OST, -OLD). These would be considered special categories. For the reasons stated above,
they shouldn’t be introduced at the same time the student is learning closed syllables with short
o sounds. O is also pronounced differently in different areas of the country. Students may
confuse COM with CALM. If so, point out that CALM starts with the sounds of the word CALL,

then adds an m at the end. Stretch out the l part of CALM (CAL-L-L-L-LM DOWN) and have the
student discover the different feeling of the word.
 A similar confusion may occur between COW and CAL, which can be addressed in the same
way. If the student is a sports fan, he or she may appreciate that Cal Ripken should not be
confused with Cow Ripken. SHORT U The -UL combination is very easily confused with the o
sound. The “Bossy L” personification can help here.
 CALLUS is the word for the things that show up on your hands from doing hard work;
CALLOUS is the adjective to describe people with “calluses on their heart.”
SHORT E Note that the /j/ sound in -JECT is always spelled with a j, while in the syllable -GEST it
is always spelled with a g (not the word, but again, don’t teach that simultaneously to avoid
confusion.) Y AS A VOWEL Since words with y as a vowel have the same sound as short i, and are
also easily confused with short e, it’s tempting to give these short shrift. Don’t! You may want to
choose useful words and learn the closed syllables with y in the context of those words. If your
students play hangman, the words where y is a vowel may prove very popular for the word
givers.
