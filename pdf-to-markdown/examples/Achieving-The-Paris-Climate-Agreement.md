In October of 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its

starkest warning yet: we have around 12  years to avoid the worst effects of

anthropogenic climate change. The consumption of fossil fuels, the reckless

destruction of forests and other natural ecosystems, and the release of powerful

greenhouse gases have already caused around 1.0  °C of warming above pre-

industrial levels.

Continuing at the current rate, we are likely to reach 1.5 °C by 2030 – and all the

evidence suggests that a world beyond 1.5 °C is not one we want to live in.

```
While making the 2016 documentary film, Before the Flood, I witnessed first-
```

hand the impacts of an already-changing climate: the rapid melting of ice in the

Arctic Circle, massive bleaching of coral reefs in the Bahamas, and rampant defor-

estation in Indonesia and the Amazon. Better than ever, we understand the heart-

breaking impact of human activity on our natural world. It is estimated, for example,

that 60% of animals have been wiped out since 1970.

Higher temperatures and extreme weather events will cause ever more severe

harm to biodiversity and ecosystems and even greater species loss and extinction.

And when we lose biodiversity, we lose resilience. Currently, natural ecosystems

absorb about half of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. If we continue to

degrade the natural world, we could lose completely the Earth’s ability to adapt to

climate change.

A passion for nature conservation and animal protection has driven much of my

foundation’s work over the past 20 years. Ultimately, however, the climate crisis is

a humanitarian one. If business-as-usual continues, the impact on human beings

will be immeasurable. Water supplies will become more insecure. Sea level rise will

profoundly impact islands, low-lying coastal areas, and river deltas. Small island

communities like those I visited in the South Pacific are already preparing for

migration to safer lands. Fatal floods, droughts, hurricanes, and wildfires are the

new normal, and happening closer to home. An estimated 41 million Americans live

within a 100-year flood zone. Texas saw its third 500-year flood 3 years in a row.

Poor air quality is a public health emergency across the world and now the

fourth-highest cause of death  – contributing to strokes, heart attacks, and lung

cancer – causing public unrest in countries like China and India, where the poorest

find themselves at the mercy of pollution from industrial facilities and the burning

of biomass. In states like Texas, Colorado, and North Dakota, communities are

fighting back against gas drilling operations near playgrounds or soccer fields,

where children breathe in poisonous gases.

These health impacts are only part of the story. Climate change, as the US

Pentagon notes, is a national security threat. In a 2017 report by the Environmental

Justice Foundation, senior US military experts pointed to the likelihood of tens of

millions of climate refugees displaced by extreme weather  – in a world already

struggling with a refugee crisis. We already know that many conflicts are driven by

environmental factors and access to natural resources. The truth is that, where

ecosystems collapse, societies collapse too.

Politically, there has been a monumental failure to grasp the scale of this problem.

Climate scientists still face disinformation campaigns and a press corps that often

draws a false equivalence between those who support the scientific consensus for

human-caused climate change and those who do not. Surveys suggest that most

Americans do not know a scientific consensus exists, and scientists like Michael

Mann, who spoke to me for _Before the Flood_, face abuse for exposing the truth. As

a result, scientific research programs, critical to better understanding and addressing

climate change, are often attacked or defunded.

Nevertheless, in the face of these challenges, some progress is being made. With

the growth of the environmental movement, public awareness of the climate crisis

has increased significantly. Governments and the private sector are beginning to

ramp up their efforts. Renewable energy is booming. And the UN Sustainable

Development Goals, ratified by 193 countries, now call for a halt to deforestation

and land degradation by 2030. After decades of climate negotiations, the Paris

Agreement now calls upon the world’s governments to keep warming “well below

2°C” while striving for 1.5°C.

While we are beginning to move in the right direction, the reality is that these

efforts are simply not ambitious enough to address the climate crisis at scale. The

IPCC warns that to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, we must stay

below the 1.5 °C limit. But what does that mean in practical terms?

Determined to find solutions, my foundation supported a 2-year research program

led by a team of international climate and energy experts to develop a roadmap for

how we can actually stay below this critical climate threshold. The findings, outlined

in this book, give cause for optimism. With a transition to 100% renewable energy

by mid-century and a major land conservation and restoration effort, it is possible to

stay below the 1.5 °C limit with technologies that are available right now. It will be

a lot of work, but the costs will be far less than the $5 trillion per year governments
currently spend subsidizing the fossil fuel industries responsible for climate change.
The climate model and energy transition pathways compiled in this book offer an
exciting, positive, and achievable vision of a better world in which we are no longer
dependent on fossil fuels and where the conservation and restoration of nature is
treated as indispensable to our survival. This is not fantasy. This is science.
Science is showing us the way forward, but you do not need to be a scientist to
understand that climate change is the defining issue of our time. If our world warms
past 1.5 °C, our way of life will profoundly change for the worse. Why not manage
the transition in a way that is orderly and equitable? Human beings caused this
problem, but with our vast knowledge and ingenuity, we can also fix it.
We are resilient. We can adapt. We can change.

#### Executive Summary

**Abstract** An overview of the motivations behind the writing of this book, the sci-
entific background and context of the research. Brief outline of all methodologies
used, followed by assumptions and the storyline of each scenario. Presentation of
main results of the renewable energy resources assessment, transport scenario, long-
term energy pathway, the power sector analysis, employment analysis and an assess-
ment for required metals for renewable energy and storage technologies. Key results
of non-energy greenhouse mitigation scenarios which are developed in support of
the energy scenario in order to achieve the 1.5 °C target. Concluding remarks and
policy recommendations including graphs and tables.

**Introduction** The Paris Climate Agreement aims to hold global warming to well

below 2 degrees Celsius (°C) and to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5 °C. To accom-

plish this, countries have submitted _Intended Nationally Determined Contributions_

(INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate actions (Rogelj 2016). This research

aimed to develop practical pathways to achieve the Paris climate goals based on a

detailed bottom-up examination of the potential of the energy sector, in order to

avoid reliance on net negative emissions later on.

The study described in this book focuses on the ways in which humans produce

energy, because energy-related carbon dioxide (CO[^2]:) emissions are the main drivers
of climate change. The analysis also considers the development pathways for non-

energy-related emissions and mitigation measures for them because it is essential to
address their contributions if we are to achieve the Paris climate change targets.

**State of Research—Climate** Beyond reasonable doubt, climate change over the
last 250  years has been driven by anthropogenic activities. In fact, the human-
induced release of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere warms the planet
even more than is currently observed as climate change, but some of that greenhouse-
gas-induced warming is masked by the effect of aerosol emissions.

xiv

Carbon dioxide emissions are so large that they are the dominant driver of
human-induced climate change. A single kilogram of CO[^2]: emitted will increase the
atmospheric CO[^2]: concentration over hundreds or even thousands of years. Since the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, the
finding that cumulative CO[^2]: emissions are roughly linearly related to temperature
has shaped scientific and political debate. The remaining permissible CO[^2]: emissions
that are consistent with a target temperature increase of 2  °C or 1.5  °C and their
comparison with remaining fossil fuel resources are of key interest.
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concluded that beyond 2011, cumulative CO2
emissions of roughly 1000 GtCO[^2]: are permissible for a “likely below 2.0 °C” target

change, and approximately 400 GtCO[^2]: are permissible for a 1.5  °C target change.
However, the recently published IPCC Special Report on the 1.5 °C target suggests

substantially higher carbon emissions of 1600 GtCO[^2]: will achieve a 2.0 °C change
and 860 GtCO2 will achieve a 1.5 °C change, which must be reduced by a further 100
GtCO[^2]: to account for additional Earth system feedback over the twenty-first century.
One of the key reasons behind this difference is definitional: how far do we consider
that we are away from 1.5 °C warming? While that question seems simple, it is sur-
prisingly complex when the observational data on coverage, the internal variability
and the pre-industrial to early-industrial temperature differences are considered.
This study does not resolve the differences in opinions about carbon budgets, but
it does provide emission pathways that are consistent with the 1.5 °C target increase
in the 1.5 °C Scenario, or with the “well below 2.0 °C” target increase in the 2.0 °C
Scenario consistent with other scenarios in the literature and classified as such by
the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C.

**Global Trends in the Energy Sector** In 2017, the ongoing trends continued: solar
photovoltaics (PV) and wind power dominated the global market for new power
plants; the price of renewable energy technologies continued to decline; and fossil
fuel prices remained low. A new benchmark was reached, in that the new renewable
capacity began to compete favourably with existing fossil fuel power plants in some
markets. Electrification of the transport and heating sectors is gaining attention, and
although the amount of electrification is currently small, the use of renewable
technologies is expected to increase significantly.

The growth of solar PV has been remarkable and is nearly double that of the
second-ranking wind power. The capacity of new solar PV in 2017 was greater than
the combined increases in the coal, gas and nuclear capacities. Renewable energy
technologies achieved a global average generation share of 23% in the year 2015,
compared with 18% in the year 2005. Storage is increasingly used in combination
with variable renewables as battery costs decline, and solar PV plus storage has
started to compete with gas peaking plants. However, bioenergy (including
traditional biomass) remains the leading renewable energy source in the heating
(buildings and industry) and transport sectors.
Since 2013, global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO[^2]:) emissions from fossil
fuels have remained relatively flat. Early estimates based on preliminary data
suggest that this changed in 2017, with global CO[^2]: emissions increasing by around
1.4% (REN21-GSR 2018). These increased emissions were primarily attributable to

increased coal consumption in China, which grew by 3.7% in 2017 after a 3-year
decline. The increased Chinese consumption, as well as a steady growth of around
4% in India, is expected to lead to an upturn in global coal use, reversing the annual
global decline from 2013 to 2016.
In 2017, as in previous years, renewables saw the greatest increases in capacity
in the power sector, whereas the growth of renewables in the heating, cooling and
transport sectors was comparatively slow. Sector coupling—the interconnection of
power, heating and transport and particularly the electrification of heating and
transport—is gaining increasing attention as a means of increasing the uptake of
renewables in the transport and thermal sectors. Sector coupling also allows the
integration of large proportions of variable renewable energy, although this is still at
an early stage. For example, China is specifically encouraging the electrification of
heating, manufacturing and transport in high-renewable areas, including promoting
the use of renewable electricity for heating to reduce the curtailment of wind, solar
PV and hydropower. Several US states are examining options for electrification,
specifically to increase the overall renewable energy share.

**Methodology for Developing Emission Pathways** The complete decarbonisation
of the global energy supply requires entirely new technical, economic and policy
frameworks for the electricity, heating and cooling sectors as well as for the trans-
port system. To develop a global plan, the authors combined various established
computer models:

• Generalized Equal Quantile Walk (GQW): This statistical method is used to
complement the CO2 pathways with non-CO2 regional emissions for relevant
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, based on a statistical analysis of the
large number (~700) of multi-gas emission pathways underlying the recent IPCC
Fifth Assessment Report and the recently published IPCC Special Report on
1.5  °C.  The GQW method calculates the median non-CO2 gas emission levels
every 5 years—conditional on the energy-related CO2 emission level percentile
of the “source” pathway. This method is a further development under this
project—building on an earlier Equal Quantile Walk method—and is now better
able to capture the emission dynamics of low-mitigation pathways.
• _Land-based sequestration design_: A Monte Carlo analysis across temperate,

```
boreal, subtropical and tropical regions has been performed based on various
literature-based estimates of sequestration rates, sequestration periods and areas
available for a number of sequestration options. This approach can be seen as a
quantified literature-based synthesis of the potential for land-based CO2
sequestration, which is not reliant on biomass plus sequestration and storage
(bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, BECCS).
```

• _Carbon cycle and climate modelling (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse_
_Gas-Induced Climate Change, MAGICC)_: This study uses the MAGICC climate
model, which also underlies the classification used by both the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report and the IPCC Special Report on 1.5  °C in terms of the
abilities of various scenarios to maintain the temperature change below 2 °C or
1.5 °C. MAGICC is constantly evolving, but its core goes back to the 1980s, and

it represents one of the most established reduced-complexity climate models in
the international community.
```

• _Renewable Resource Assessment [R]E-SPACE_: RE-SPACE is based on a

```
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) approach and provides maps of the solar
and wind potentials in space-constrained environments. GIS attempts to emulate
processes in the real world at a single point in time or over an extended period
(Goodchild 2005). The primary purpose of GIS mapping is to ascertain the
renewable energy resources (primarily solar and wind) available in each region.
It also provides an overview of the existing electricity infrastructures for fossil
fuel and renewable sources.
```

• _Transport model (TRAEM)_: The transport scenario model allows the

```
representation of long-term transport developments in a consistent and transparent
way. The model disaggregates transport into a set of different modes and
calculates the final energy demand by multiplying each transport mode’s specific
transport demand with powertrain-specific energy demands, using a passenger
km (pkm) and tonne km (tkm) activity-based bottom-up approach.
```

• _Energy system model (EM)_: The energy system model (a long-term energy

```
scenario model) is used as a mathematical accounting system for the energy
sector. It helps to model the development of energy demands and supply
according to the development of drivers and energy intensities, energy potentials,
future costs, emission targets, specific fuel consumption and the physical flow
between processes. The data available significantly influence the model
architecture and approach. The energy system model is used in this study to
develop long-term scenarios for the energy system across all sectors (power,
heat, transport and industry), without applying cost-optimization based on
uncertain cost assumptions. However, an ex-post analysis of costs and investments
shows the main economic effects of the pathways.
```

• _Power system models [R]E 24/7_: Power system models simulate electricity

```
systems on an hourly basis with geographic resolution to assess the requirements
for infrastructure, such as the grid connections between different regions and
electricity storage, depending on the demand profiles and power-generation
characteristics (Teske 2015). High-penetration or renewable energy-only
scenarios will contain significant proportions of variable solar PV and wind
power because they are inexpensive. Therefore, power system models are
required to assess the demand and supply patterns, the efficiency of power
generation and the resulting infrastructural needs. Meteorological data, typically
in 1 h steps, are required for the power-generation model, and historical solar and
wind data were used to calculate the possible renewable power generation. In
terms of demand, either historical demand curves were used, or if unavailable,
demand curves were calculated based on assumptions of consumer behaviour in
the use of electrical equipment and common electrical appliances. Figure 1
provides an overview of the interaction between the energy- and GIS-based
models. The climate model is not directly linked with it but provided the carbon
budgets for the 2.0 °C and the 1.5 °C Scenarios.

Executive Summary

xviii

Besides the climate and energy models, employment effects and the metal
resource requirements for selected materials have been calculated. Now that the
methodology has been outlined, the next sections present the results and assumptions
for the nonenergy GHG mitigation scenarios, followed by the energy sector
scenarios

**Nonenergy-GHG Mitigation Scenarios** The most important sequestration
measure could be large-scale reforestation, particularly in the subtropics and tropics
(see yellow pathways in Fig. [^2]:). The second most important pathway in terms of the
amount of CO[^2]: sequestered is the sustainable use of existing forests, which basically
means reduced logging within those forests. In subtropical, temperate and boreal
regions, this could provide substantial additional carbon uptake over time. The time
horizon for this sequestration option is assumed to be slightly longer in temperate
and boreal regions, consistent with the longer time it takes for these forest ecosystems
to reach equilibrium. The “forest ecosystem restoration” pathway is also important,
which basically assumes a reduction in logging rates to zero in a fraction of forests.

Overall, the median assumed sequestration pathways, shown in Fig. [^2]:, would
result in the sequestration of 151.9  GtC.  This is approximately equivalent to all
historical land-use-related CO[^2]: emissions and indicates the substantial challenges
that accompany these sequestration pathways.

Given the competing forms of land use throughout the world today, the challenge of

reversing overall terrestrial carbon stocks back to pre-industrial levels cannot be

underestimated. There would be significant benefits, but also risks, if this

sequestration option were to be used _instead_ of mitigation. However, the benefits
are clearly manifold, ranging from biodiversity protection, reduced erosion,
improved local climates, protection from wind and potentially reduced air pollution.

**Assumptions for Scenarios** Scenario studies cannot predict the future. Instead,
scenarios describe what is required for a pathway that will limit warming to a certain
level and that is feasible in terms of technology implementation and investment.
Scenarios also allow us to explore the possible effects of transition processes, such
as supply costs and emissions. The energy demand and supply scenarios described
in this study have been constructed based on information about current energy
structures and today’s knowledge of energy resources and the costs involved in
deploying them. As far as possible, the study also takes into account potential
regional constraints and preferences.

The energy modelling used primarily aims to generate transparent and coherent
scenarios, ambitious but still plausible storylines, out of several possible techno-
economic pathways. Knowledge integration is the core of this approach because we
must consider different technical, economic, environmental and societal factors.
Scenario modelling follows a hybrid bottom-up/top-down approach, with no
objective cost-optimization functions. The analysis considers key technologies for
successful energy transition and focuses on the role and potential utility of efficiency
measures and renewable energies. Wind and solar energies have the highest
economic potential and dominate the pathways on the supply side. However, the
variable renewable power from wind and PV remains limited to a maximum of
65%, because sufficient secured capacity must always be maintained in the
electricity system. Therefore, we also consider concentrating solar power (CSP)
with high-temperature heat storage as a solar option that promises large-scale
dispatchable and secured power generation.

_The 5.0 °C Scenario (Reference Scenario):_ The reference scenario only takes into

account existing international energy and environmental policies and is based on the

International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook (IEA 2017). Its

assumptions include, for example, continuing progress in electricity and gas market

reforms, the liberalization of cross-border energy trade and recent policies designed

to combat environmental pollution. The scenario does not include additional policies

to reduce GHG emissions. Because the IEA’s projections only extend to 2040, we

extrapolate their key macroeconomic and energy indicators forward to 2050. This

provides a baseline for comparison with the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios.

_The 2.0 °C Scenario:_ The first alternative scenario aims for an ambitious reduction

in GHG emissions to zero by 2050 and a global energy-related CO[^2]: emission budget
of around 590 Gt between 2015 and 2050. This scenario is close to the assumptions
and results of the Advanced E[R] scenario published in 2015 by Greenpeace (Teske
et  al. 2015). However, it includes an updated base year, more coherent regional
developments in energy intensity, and reconsidered trajectories and shares of the
deployment of renewable energy systems. Compared with the 1.5 °C Scenario, the

2.0 °C Scenario allows for some delays due to political, economic and societal pro-
cesses and stakeholders.

_The 1.5  °C Scenario:_ The second alternative scenario aims to achieve a global
energy-related CO[^2]: emission budget of around 450 Gt, accumulated between 2015
and 2050. The 1.5  °C Scenario requires immediate action to realize all available
options. It is a technical pathway, not a political prognosis. It refers to technically
possible measures and options without taking into account societal barriers.
Efficiency and renewable potentials need to be deployed even more quickly than in
the 2.0  °C Scenario, and avoiding inefficient technologies and behaviours is an
essential strategy for developing regions in this scenario.

**Global Transport** Transport emissions have increased at a rapid rate in recent
decades and accounted for 21% of total anthropogenic CO[^2]: emissions in 2015. The
reason for this steady increase in emissions is that passenger and freight transport

activities are increasing in all world regions, and there is currently no sign that these

increases will slow in the near future. The increasing demand for energy for transport

has so far been predominantly met by GHG-emitting fossil fuels. Although (battery)

electric mobility has recently surged considerably, it has done so from a very low

base, which is why in terms of total numbers, electricity remains an energy carrier

with a relatively minor role in the transport sector.

The key results of our transport modelling demonstrate that meeting the 2.0 °C

Scenario, and especially the 1.5  °C Scenario, will require profound measures in

terms of rapid powertrain electrification and the use of biofuels and synthetically

produced fuels to shift transport performance to more efficient modes. This must be

accompanied by a general limitation of further pkm and tkm growth in the OECD

countries.

```
The 5.0  °C Scenario follows the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) scenario
```

until 2040, with extrapolation to 2050. Only a minor increase in electrification over

all transport modes is assumed, with passenger cars and buses increasing their

electric vehicle (EV) shares. For example, this study projects a share of 30% for

battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in China by 2050  in response to the foreseeable

legislation and technological advancement in that country, whereas for the world car

fleet, the share of BEVs is projected to increase to only around 10%. Growth in the

shares of electric powertrains and two- and three-wheel vehicles in the commercial

road vehicle fleet will be small, as will the rise in further rail electrification. Aviation

and navigation (shipping) are assumed to remain fully dependent on conventional

kerosene and diesel, respectively.

```
In the 2.0 °C Scenario minimal progress in electrification until 2020 will occur,
```

whereas a significant increase in electrification of the transport sector between 2020

and 2030 is projected. This will occur first in OECD regions, followed by emerging

economies and finally in developing countries. Battery-driven electric passenger

cars are projected to achieve shares of between 21% and 30%, whereas heavy

commercial electric vehicles and buses could achieve even higher shares of between

28% and 52% by 2030. This uptake will require a massive build-up of battery

production capacity in coming years. Two- and three-wheel vehicles—mainly used

in Asia and Africa—will be nearly completely electrified (batteries and fuel cells)

by 2030. Looking ahead to 2050, 60–70% of buses and heavy trucks will become

(battery-driven) electric, and fuel-cell electric vehicles will increase their market

share to around 37%. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, developing countries in Africa and

countries in the oil-producing countries of the Middle East will remain predominantly

dependent on internal combustion engines, using bio- or synthetic-based fuels.

```
In the 1.5 °C Scenario, an earlier and more rapid increase in electric powertrain
```

penetration is required, with the OECD regions at the forefront. The emerging eco-

nomic regions must also electrify more rapidly than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. On a

global level, internal combustion engines will be almost entirely phased out by 2050

in both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. In OECD regions, cars with internal com-

bustion engines (using oil-based fuels) will be phased out by 2040, whereas in Latin

America or Africa, for example, a small share of internal combustion engine inter-

nal combustion engine (ICE)-powered cars, fuelled with biofuels or synthetic fuels,

will still be on the road but will be constantly replaced by electric drivetrains

(Fig. [^3]:).

Efficiency improvements are modelled across all transport modes until 2050,

resulting in improved energy intensity over time. We project an increase in annual

efficiency of 0.5–1% in terms of MJ/tonnes km or MJ/passenger km, depending on

the transport mode and region. Regardless of the types of powertrains and fuels,

increasing the efficiency at the MJ/pkm or MJ/tkm level will result from the follow-

ing measures:

– Reductions in powertrain losses through more efficient motors, gears, power

electronics, etc.

– Reductions in aerodynamic drag
– Reductions in vehicle mass through lightweighting
– The use of smaller vehicles
– Operational improvements (e.g. through automatic train operation, load factor

improvements)

Transport performance will increase in all scenarios on a global scale but with dif-

ferent speeds and intensities across modes and world regions. Current trends in

transport performance until 2050 are extrapolated for the 5.0 °C Scenario. In rela-
tive terms, all transport carriers will increase their performance from the current
levels, and in particular, energy-intensive aviation, passenger car transport and com-
mercial road transport are projected to grow strongly. In the 2.0  °C Scenario and
1.5 °C Scenario, we project a strong increase in rail traffic (starting from a relatively
low base) and slower growth or even a decline in the use of the other modes in all
world regions (Fig. [^4]:).
The modal shifts from domestic aviation to rail and from road to rail are mod-
elled. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, passenger car pkm must decrease in the
OECD countries (but increase in the developing world regions) after 2020 in order
to maintain the carbon budget. The passenger car pkm decline will be partly com-
pensated by an increase in the performances of other transport modes, specifically
public transport rail and bus systems.

**Global Renewable Energy Potential** To develop the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios,

the economic renewable energy potential in a space-constrained environment was

analysed. Land is a scarce resource. The use of land for nature conservation, agri-

cultural production, residential areas and industry, as well as for infrastructure such

as roads and all aspects of human settlement, limits the amount of land available for

utility-scale solar and wind projects. Furthermore, solar and wind generation

requires favourable climatic conditions, so not all available areas are suitable for

renewable power generation. To assess the renewable energy potential based on the

area available, all scenario-relevant regions and subregions were analysed with the

[R]E-SPACE methodology to quantify the available land area in square kilometres

with a defined set of constraints:

– Residential and urban settlements
– Infrastructure for transport (e.g. rail, roads)
– Industrial areas
– Intensive agricultural production land
– Nature conservation areas and national parks
– Wetlands and swamps
– Closed grasslands (as the land-use type)

```
In addition to this spatial analysis, the remaining available land areas were cor-
```

related with the available solar and wind resources. For CSP, a minimum solar radi-

ation of 2000 kilowatt hours per square meter and year (kWh/m[^2] year) is assumed

to be the minimum deployment criterion, whereas the onshore wind potential under
an average annual wind speed of 5 m/s has been omitted.
The 2.0 °C Scenario utilizes only a fraction of the available economic potential
of the assumed suitable land for utility-scale solar PV and CSP plants. This estimate
does not include solar PV rooftop systems, which have significant additional
potential. India has the highest solar utilization rate of 8.5%, followed by Europe
and the Middle East, each of which utilizes around 5%. Onshore wind potential has
been utilized to a larger extent than solar potential. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, space-
constrained India will utilize about half of all the onshore wind energy utilized,
followed by Europe, which will utilize one fifth. This wind potential excludes
offshore wind, which has significant potential, but mapping the offshore wind
potential was beyond the scope of this analysis.
The 1.5  °C Scenario is based on the accelerated deployment of all renewables
and the more ambitions implementation of efficiency measures. Thus, the total
installed capacity of solar and wind power plants by 2050 is not necessarily larger
than it is in the 2.0  °C Scenario, and the utilization rate is in the same order of
magnitude. The increased deployment of renewable capacity in the OECD Pacific
(Australia), the Middle East and Africa will be due to the production of synthetic
bunker fuels based on hydrogen or synthetic fuels (_synfuels_) to supply the global
transport energy for international shipping and aviation.
**Key results of the global long-term energy scenarios** show that the efficiency
and uptake of renewable energy are two sides of the same coin. All sectors, including

Executive Summary

xxiv

transport, industry and all commercial and residential buildings, must use energy

efficiently and from a huge range of renewable energy technologies. Compared with

the 5.0  °C Scenario, which was defined using assumptions from the IEA, the

alternative scenarios require more stringent efficiency levels. The 1.5 °C Scenario

involves the even faster implementation of efficiency measures than in the 2.0 °C

Scenario and the decelerated growth of energy services in all regions, in order to

avoid a further strong increase in fossil fuel use after 2020.

```
Global energy intensity will decline from 2.4 MJ/US$GDP in 2015 to 1.25 MJ/
```

US$GDP in 2050 in the 5.0 °C Scenario compared with 0.65 MJ/US$GDP in the

2.0 °C Scenario and 0.59 MJ/US$GDP in the 1.5 °C Scenario. This is a result of the

estimated power, heat and fuel demands for all sectors, with more stringent efficiency

levels in the alternative scenarios than in the 5.0  °C case. It reflects a further

decoupling of the energy demand and gross domestic product (GDP) growth as a

prerequisite for the rapid decarbonisation of the global energy system.

```
Total final energy demand is estimated based on assumptions about the demand
```

drivers, specific energy consumption and the development of energy services in

each region. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the global energy demand will increase by 57%

from 342 EJ/year in 2015 to 537 EJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final

energy will be 19% lower than the current consumption and will reach 278 EJ/year

by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will be 253 EJ, 26% below

the 2015 demand, and, in 2050, will be 9% lower than in the 2.0 °C Scenario.

```
Global electricity demand will significantly increase in the alternative scenarios
```

due to the electrification of the transport and heating sectors, which will replace

fuels, but will also be due to a moderate increase in the electricity demand of

“classical” electrical devices on a global level. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the electricity

demand for heating will be about 12,600 TWh/year from electric heaters and heat

pumps, and, in the transport sector, there will be an increase of about 23,400 TWh/

year due to electric mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and

high-temperature process heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels for transport

will add an additional power demand of 18,800 TWh/year. The gross power demand

will thus rise from 24,300 TWh/year in 2015 to 65,900 TWh/year in 2050  in the

2.0 °C Scenario, 34% higher than in the 5.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the

gross electricity demand will increase to a maximum of 65,300 TWh/year in 2050.

```
Global electricity generation from renewable energy sources will reach 100% by
```

2050  in the alternative scenarios. “New” renewables—mainly wind, solar and

geothermal energy—will contribute 83% of the total electricity generated. The

contribution of renewable electricity to total production will be 62% by 2030 and

88% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 9500 GW by

2030 and 25,600  GW by 2050. The proportion of electricity generated from

renewables in 2030  in the 1.5  °C Scenario is assumed to be 73%. The 1.5  °C

Scenario will have a generation capacity of renewable energy of about 25,700 GW

in 2050.

From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and PV to 7850  GW and

12,300 GW, respectively, will be complemented by the generation of up to 2060 GW

of solar thermal energy as well as limited biomass-derived (770 GW), geothermal

(560 GW) and ocean-derived energy (around 500 GW) in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both
the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will lead to the generation of high proportions (38%
and 46%, respectively) of energy from variable power sources (PV, wind and ocean)
by 2030, which will increase to 64% and 65%, respectively, by 2050. This will
require a significant change in how the power system is operated. The main findings
of the power sector analysis are summarized in the section below.
_Calculated average electricity-generation costs_ in 2015 (referring to full costs)
were around 6 ct/kWh. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, these generation costs will increase,
assuming rising CO[^2]: emission costs in the future, until 2050, when they reach
10.6 ct/kWh. The generation costs will increase in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios
until 2030, when they will reach 9 ct/kWh, and then drop to 7 ct/kWh by 2050. In
both alternative scenarios, the generation costs will be around 3.5  ct/kWh lower
than in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 2050. Note that these estimates of generation costs
do not take into account integration costs such as power grid expansion, storage and
other load-balancing measures.
_Total electricity supply costs_ in the 5.0 °C Scenario will increase from today’s
$1560 billion/year to more than $5 500 billion/year in 2050, due to the growth in
demand and increasing fossil fuel prices. In both alternative scenarios, the total
supply costs will be $5050 billion/year in 2050, about 8% lower than in the 5.0 °C
Scenario.
_Global investment in power generation_ between 2015 and 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario will be around $49,000 billion, which will include additional power plants
to produce hydrogen and synthetic fuels and the plant replacement costs at the end
of their economic lifetimes. This value is equivalent to approximately $1360 billion
per year on average, which is $28,600  billion more than in the 5.0  °C Scenario
($20,400  billion). An investment of around $51,000  billion for power generation
will be required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario ($1420 billion per
year on average). In both alternative scenarios, the world will shift almost 95% of
its total energy investment to renewables and cogeneration.

_Fuel Cost Savings_ Because renewable energy has no fuel costs other than biomass,
the cumulative savings in fuel cost in the 2.0  °C Scenario will reach a total of
$26,300 billion in 2050, equivalent to $730 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel
costs in the 2.0 °C Scenario will be equivalent to 90% of the energy investments in
the 5.0  °C Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5  °C Scenario will sum to
$28,800 billion or $800 billion per year.

_Final energy demand for heating_ will increase by 59% in the 5.0  °C Scenario
from 151 EJ/year in 2015 to around 240 EJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 36% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario, relative to that in the 5.0 °C case, and by 40% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

_Global Heat Supply_ In 2015, renewables supplied around 20% of the final global

energy demand for heating, mainly from biomass. Renewable energy will provide

42% of the world’s total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 56% in the

1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat

Executive Summary

xxvi

demand in 2050. This will include the direct use of electricity for heating, which
will increase by a factor of 4.2–4.5 between 2015 and 2050 and will constitute a
final share of 26% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 30% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

_Estimated investments in renewable heating technologies_ to 2050 will amount to
more than $13,200 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments for plant
replacement after their economic lifetimes)—approximately $368 billion per year.
The largest share of investment is assumed to be for heat pumps (around
$5700  billion), followed by solar collectors and geothermal heat use. The 1.5  °C
Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technologies. However, the
lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0  °C Scenario) will result in a lower
average annual investment of around $344 billion per year.
_Energy demand in the transport sector_ will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario from
around 97 EJ/year in 2015 by 50% to 146 EJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario,
assumed changes in technical, structural and behavioural factors will reduce this by
66% (96  EJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario. Additional modal
shifts, technological changes and a reduction in the transport demand will lead to
even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 74% (or 108 EJ/year) in 2050
compared with the 5.0 °C case.

_Transport Energy Supply_ By 2030, electricity will provide 12% (2700 TWh/year)
of the transport sector’s total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and, in 2050,
this share will be 47% (6500 TWh/year). In 2050, around 8430 PJ/year of hydrogen
will be used as a complementary renewable option in the transport sector. In the
1.5  °C Scenario, the annual electricity demand will be about 5200  TWh in 2050.
The 1.5  °C Scenario also assumes a hydrogen demand of 6850  PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use will be limited to a maximum of around 12,000 PJ/year in the 2.0 °C
Scenario. Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be
introduced, with a maximum amount of 5820 PJ/year in 2050. Because of the lower
overall energy demand in transport, biofuel use will decrease in the 1.5 °C Scenario
to a maximum of 10,000 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount
to 6300 PJ/year.

_Global primary energy demand_ in the 2.0  °C Scenario will decrease by 21%
from around 556 EJ/year in 2015 to 439 EJ/year. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario,
the overall primary energy demand will decrease by 48% by 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario (5.0  °C, 837 EJ in 2050). In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the primary energy
demand will be even lower (412 EJ) in 2050 because the final energy demand and
conversion losses will be lower.

_Global Primary Energy Supply_ Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly

phase out coal and oil, after which renewable energy will have a primary energy

share of 35% in 2030 and 92% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario,

renewables will have a primary share of more than 92% in 2050 (this will include

nonenergy consumption, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy is

phased out in both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy

consumption of natural gas in the 5.0  °C Scenario will sum to 5580  EJ, the

```
Executive Summary
```

```
xxvii
```

cumulative coal consumption will be about 6360 EJ, and the crude oil consumption
to 6380  EJ.  In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand is 3140  EJ, the
cumulative coal demand 2340  EJ and the cumulative oil demand 2960  EJ.  Even
lower fossil fuel use will be achieved under the 1.5 °C Scenario: 2710 EJ for natural
gas, 1570 EJ for coal and 2230 EJ for oil. In both alternative scenarios, the primary
energy supply in 2050 will be based on 100% renewable energy (Fig. [^5]:).

_Bunker Fuels_ In 2015, the annual bunker fuel consumption was in the order of
16,000 PJ, of which 7400 PJ was for aviation and 8600 PJ for navigation. Annual
CO[^2]: emissions from bunker fuels accounted for 1.3 Gt in 2015, approximately 4%
of the global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions. In the 5.0  °C case, we assume the
development of the final energy demand for bunkers according to the IEA World
Energy Outlook 2017, Current Policies scenario. This will lead to a further increase
in the demand for bunker fuels by 120% until 2050 compared with the base year

2015. Because no substitution with “green” fuels is assumed, CO2 emissions will
rise by the same order of magnitude. Although the use of hydrogen and electricity

in aviation is technically feasible (at least for regional transport) and synthetic gas

use in navigation is an additional option under discussion, this analysis adopts a

conservative approach and assumes that bunker fuels are only replaced by biofuels

and synthetic liquid fuels. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, we assume the limited

use of sustainable biomass potentials and the complementary central production of

power-to-liquid synfuels.

In the 2.0 °C Scenario, this production is assumed to take place in three world

regions: Africa, the Middle East and OECD Pacific (especially Australia), where

synfuel generation for export is expected to be most economic. The 1.5 °C Scenario

requires even faster decarbonisation, so it follows a more ambitious low-energy

pathway. The production of synthetic fuels will cause significant additional

electricity demand and a corresponding expansion of renewable power-generation

capacities. In the case of liquid bunker fuels, these additional renewable

power-generation capacities could amount to 1100 GW in the 2.0 °C Scenario and
more than 1200 GW in the 1.5 °C Scenario if the flexible utilization of 4000 full-
load hours per year can be achieved. However, such a scenario requires high elec-
trolyser capacities and high-volume hydrogen storage to ensure not only flexibility
in the power system but also high utilization rates by downstream synthesis pro-
cesses (e.g. via Fischer-Tropsch plants).
_Annual global energy-related CO_[^2]: _emissions_ will increase by 40% in the 5.0 °C
Scenario, from 31,180 Mt in 2015 to more than 43,500 Mt in 2050. The stringent
mitigation measures in both alternative scenarios will cause annual emissions to fall
to 7070 Mt in 2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 2650 Mt in the 1.5 °C Scenario,
with further reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative
CO[^2]: emissions from 2015 until 2050 will sum to 1388 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C
and 1.5 °C Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050
will be 587 Gt and 450 Gt, respectively. Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
will decrease by 58% in the 2.0  °C Scenario and by 68% in the 1.5  °C Scenario

compared with the 5.0  °C case. Thus, a rapid reduction in annual emissions will

occur in both alternative scenarios.

**Global Power Sector Analysis**

Global and regional long-term energy results were used to conduct a detailed power

sector analysis with the methodology described in Sect. 1.7 of Chap. [^3]:. Both the

2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios rely on high proportions of variable solar and wind

generation. The aim of the power sector analysis was to gain insight into the stability

of the power system in each region—subdivided into up to eight subregions—and

to gauge the extent to which power grid interconnections, dispatch generation

services and storage technologies are required. The results presented in this chapter

are projections calculated based on publicly available data. Detailed load curves for

some subregions and countries were not available, or, in some cases, the relevant

information is classified. Therefore, the outcomes of the [R]E 24/7 model are

estimates and require further research with more detailed localized data, especially

regarding the available power grid infrastructures. The power sector projections for

developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia, assume unilateral access to

energy services by the residential sector by 2050 and require transmission and

distribution grids in regions where there are none at the time of writing. Further

research, in cooperation with local utilities and government representatives, is

required to develop a more detailed understanding of the power infrastructure needs.

_Development of Global Power Plant Capacities_ The size of the global market for

renewable power plants will increase significantly under the 2.0 °C Scenario. The
annual market for solar PV power must increase by a factor of 4.5, from close to
100 GW in 2017 to an average of 454 GW by 2030. The annual onshore wind mar-
ket must expand to 172 GW by 2025, about three times higher than in 2017. The
offshore wind market will continue to increase in importance within the renewable
power sector. By 2050, offshore wind installations will increase to 32  GW annu-
ally—11 times higher than in 2017. Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants will
play an important role in the generation of dispatchable solar electricity to supply

bulk power, especially for industry, and to provide secured capacities to power sys-
tems. By 2030, the annual CSP market must increase to 78  GW, compared with
3 GW in 2020 and only 0.1 GW in 2017.

```
In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the phase-out of coal and lignite power plants is acceler-
```

ated, and a total capacity of 618 GW—equivalent to approximately 515 power sta-

tions (1.2 GW on average)—must end operation by 2025. This will mean a phase-out

of two coal power plants per week from 2020 onwards, on average. The replacement

power will come from a variety of renewable power generators, both variable and

dispatchable. The annual market for solar PV energy must be around 30% higher

than it was in 2025, as under the 2.0 °C Scenario. The onshore wind market also has

an accelerated trajectory under the 1.5 °C Scenario, whereas the offshore wind mar-

ket is assumed to be almost identical to that in the 2.0 °C Scenario, because of long

lead times for these projects. The same is assumed for CSP plants, which are utility-

scale projects, and significantly higher deployment seems unlikely in the time

remaining until 2025.

_Utilization of Power Plant Capacities_ On a global scale, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C

Scenarios, the shares of variable renewable power generation will increase from 4%
in 2015 to 38% and 46%, respectively, by 2030, and will increase to 64% and 65%,
respectively, by 2050. The reason for the variations in the two cases is the different
assumptions made regarding efficiency measures, which may lead to lower overall
demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. During the same period,
dispatchable renewables—CSP plants, bioenergy generation, geothermal energy
and hydropower—will remain around 32% until 2030 on a global average and then
decrease slightly to 29% under the 2.0 °C Scenario (and to 27% under the 1.5 °C
Scenario) by 2050. The system share of dispatchable conventional generation
capacities—mainly coal, oil, gas and nuclear energy—will decrease from a global
average of 60% in 2015 to only 14% in 2040. By 2050, the remaining dispatchable
conventional gas power plants will be converted to operate on hydrogen as a
synthetic fuel, to avoid stranded investments and to achieve higher dispatch power
capacities. Increased variable shares—mainly in the USA, the Middle East region
and Australia—will produce hydrogen for local and the export markets, as fuel for
both renewable power plants and the transport sector.

_Development of Maximum and Residual Loads for the Ten World Regions_ The
maximum load will increase in all regions and within similar ranges under both the
2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The load in OECD countries will rise most strongly in
response to increased electrification, mainly in the transport sector, whereas the load
in developing countries will increase as the overall electricity demand increases in
all sectors.

The most significant increase will be in Africa, where the maximum load will
surge by 534% over the entire modelling period due to favourable economic
development and increased access to energy services by households. In OECD
Pacific (South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand), efficiency measures will

reduce the maximum load to 87% by 2030 relative to that in the base year, and it
will increase to 116% by 2050 with the expansion of electric mobility and the
increased electrification of the process heat supply in the industry sector. The 1.5 °C
Scenario calculates slightly higher loads in 2030 due to the accelerated electrifica-
tion of the industry, heating and business sectors, except in three regions (the Middle
East, India and Non-OECD Asia Other Asia), where the early application of effi-
ciency measures will lead to an overall lower demand at the end of the modelling
period, for the same GDP and population growth rates.
In this analysis, the residual load is the load remaining after the variable renew-
able power generation. Negative values indicate that the energy generated from
solar and wind exceeds the actual load and must be exported to other regions, stored
or curtailed. In each region, the average generation should be consistent with the
average load. However, maximum loads and maximum generations do not usually
occur at the same time, so surplus electricity can be produced and must be exported
or stored as far as possible. In rare individual cases, solar- or wind-based generation
plants can also temporarily reduce their output to a lower load, or some plants can
be shut down. Any reduction in energy generation from solar and wind sources in
response to low demands is defined as “curtailment”. In this analysis, curtailment
rates of up to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2050 are assumed to have no substantial
negative economic impact on the operation of power plants and therefore will not
trigger an increase in storage capacities. Figure [^6]: illustrates the development of
maximum loads across all ten world regions under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios.

_Global Storage and Dispatch Capacities_ The world market for storage and dis-

patch technologies and services will increase significantly in the 2.0 °C Scenario.

The annual market for new hydro-pumped storage plants will grow on average by

6 GW per year to a total capacity of 244 GW in 2030. During the same period, the

total installed capacity of batteries will increase to 12 GW, requiring an annual mar-

ket of 1  GW.  Between 2030 and 2050, the energy service sector for storage and

storage technologies must accelerate further. The battery market must grow by an

annual installation rate of 22 GW and, as a result, will overtake the global cumula-

tive capacity of pumped hydro between 2040 and 2050. The conversion of gas infra-

structure from natural gas to hydrogen and synthetic fuels will start slowly between

2020 and 2030, with the conversion of power plants with annual capacities of

around 2 GW. However, after 2030, the transformation of the global gas industry to

hydrogen will accelerate significantly, with the conversion of a total of 197 GW gas

power plants and gas cogeneration facilities each year. In parallel, the average

capacity of gas and hydrogen plants will decrease from 29% (2578 h/year) in 2030

to 11% (975 h/year) by 2050, converting the gas sector from a supply-driven to a

service-driven industry.

At around 2030, the 1.5 °C Scenario will require more storage throughput than

the 2.0 °C Scenario, but the storage demands for the two scenarios will be equal at

the end of the modelling period. It is assumed that the higher throughput can be

managed with equally higher installed capacities, leading to full-load hours of up to

200 h per year for batteries and hydro-pumped storage.

_Trajectories for a Just Transition of the Fossil Fuel Industry_ The implementation of

the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will have a significant impact on the global fossil
fuel industry. While this may appear to be stating the obvious, current climate
debates have not yet led to an open debate about the orderly withdrawal from the
coal, oil and gas extraction industries. Instead, the political debate about coal, oil
and gas is focused on the security of supply and price security. However, mitigating
climate change is only possible when fossil fuels are phased out.

Coal: Under the 5.0  °C Scenario, the required production of thermal coal—
excluding coal for nonenergy uses, such as steel production—will remain at 2015
levels, with an annual increase of around 1% per year until 2050. Under the 2.0 °C
Scenario, coal production will decline sharply between 2020 and 2030 at a rate of
around 6% per year. By 2030, global coal production will be equal to China’s annual
production in 2017, at 3.7 billion tonnes, whereas that volume will be reached in
2025 under the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Executive Summary

Oil: Oil production in the 5.0  °C Scenario will grow steadily by 1% annually
until the end of the modelling period in 2050. Under the 2.0 °C Scenario, oil produc-
tion will decline by 3% annually until 2025 and then by 5% per year until 2030.
After 2030, oil production will decline by around 7% per year on average, until the
oil produced for energy use is phased out entirely by 2050. The oil production
capacity of the USA, Saudi Arabia and Russia in 2017 would be sufficient to supply
the global demand in 2035 calculated under the 2.0 °C Scenario. The 1.5 °C Scenario
reduces the required production volume by half by 2030, reducing it further to the
equivalent of the 2017 production volume of just one of the three largest oil produc-
ers (USA, Saudi Arabia or Russia) by 2040.
Gas: In the 5.0 °C Scenario, gas production will increase steadily by 2% a year
for the next two decades, leading to an overall production increase of about 50% by

2050. Compared with coal and oil, the gas phase-out will be significantly slower in
the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios. These scenarios also assume that the gas
infrastructure, such as gas pipelines and power plants, will be used afterwards for
the hydrogen and/or renewable methane produced with electricity from renewable
sources. Under the 2.0 °C Scenario, gas production will only decrease by 0.2% per
year until 2025, by 1% until 2030 and, on average, by 4% annually until 2040. This
represents a rather slow phase-out and will allow the gas industry to gradually
transfer to hydrogen. The phase-out in the 1.5 °C Scenario is equally slow, and a
4%/year reduction will occur after 2025.
The trajectories predicted by the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios for global coal, oil
and gas production are consistent with the Paris Agreement targets and can be used
to calculate possible employment effects, in terms of job losses in the fossil fuel
industry, job gains in the renewable energy industry and options for transitioning the
gas industry into an industry based on renewably produced hydrogen.

**Employment** The transition to a 100% renewable energy system is not just a tech-

nical task, it is also a socially and economically challenging process. It is imperative

that this transition is managed in a fair and equitable way. One of the key concerns

is the employment of workers in the affected industries. However, it should be noted

that the “just transition” concept is concerned not only with workers’ rights but also

with the broader community. This includes considering, for example, community

participation in decision-making processes, public dialogue and policy mechanisms

that create an enabling environment for new industries to ensure local economic

development. Although it is acknowledged that a just transition is important, there

are limited data on the effects that this transition will have on employment. There is

even less information on the types of occupations that will be affected by the transi-

tion, either by project growth or declines in employment. This study provides pro-

jections for jobs in construction, manufacturing, operations and maintenance and

fuel and heat supply across 12 technologies and 10 world regions, based on the

5.0 °C, 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Projected employment is calculated regionally,

but the results are presented at the global level.

_Employment—Quantitative Results_ The 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will generate
more energy-sector jobs in the world as a whole at every stage of the projection. The
1.5  °C Scenario will increase renewable energy capacities faster than the 2.0  °C
Scenario, and, therefore, employment will increase faster. By 2050, both scenarios
will create around 47 million jobs, so employment will be within similar ranges.

• In 2025, there will be 30.9 million energy-sector jobs under the 5.0 °C Scenario,
45.5 million under the 2.0 °C Scenario and 52.3 million under the 1.5 °C.
• In 2030, there will be 31.7 million energy-sector jobs under the 5.0 °C Scenario,
52.9  million under the 2.0  °C Scenario and 58.5  million under the 1.5  °C
Scenario.
• In 2050, there will be 29.9 million energy-sector jobs under the 5.0 °C Scenario,
48.7  million under the 2.0  °C Scenario and 46.3  million under the 1.5  °C
Scenario.

Under the 5.0 °C Scenario, job will drop to 4% below the 2015 levels by 2020 and
then remain quite stable until 2030. Strong growth in renewable energy will lead to
an increase of 44% in total energy-sector jobs by 2025 under the 2.0 °C Scenario and
66% under the 1.5 °C Scenario. In the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, renewable energy
jobs will account for 81% (86%) in 2025 and 87% (89%) in 2030, with PV having
the greatest share of 24% (26%), followed by biomass, wind and solar heating.

_Employment—Occupational Calculations_ Jobs will increase across all occupations

between 2015 and 2025, except in metal trades, which display a minor decline of

2%, as shown in Fig. [^7]:. However, these results are not uniform across regions. For

example, China and India will both experience a reduction in the number of jobs for

managers and clerical and administrative workers between 2015 and 2025.

**Mineral and Metal Requirements Under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios** Within

the context of the increasing requirements for metal resources by renewable energy
and storage technologies, the rapid increases in demands for both cobalt and lithium
are of greatest concern. The demands for both metals will exceed the current
production rates by 2023 and 2022, respectively. The demands for these metals will
increase more rapidly than will that for silver, partly because solar PV is a more
established technology and silver use has become very efficient, whereas the
electrification of the transport system and the rapid expansion in lithium battery use
have only begun to accelerate in the last few years. The potential to offset primary
demand is different depending on the technology. Offsetting demand through
secondary sources of cobalt and lithium has the most potential to reduce total
primary demand, as these technologies have a shorter lifetime of approximately 10
years. The cumulative demands for both metals will exceed current reserves, but
with high recycling rates, they can remain below the resource levels. However, there
is a delay in the period during which recycling can offset demand, because there
must be sufficient batteries in use and they must exhaust their current purpose before
they can be collected and recycled. This delay could be further extended by strategies
that reuse vehicular batteries as stationary storage, which might reduce costs in the

short term and increase the uptake of PV. The efficiency of cobalt in batteries also

significantly reduces its demand, and this reduction is already happening as manu-

facturers move towards lower cobalt chemistries.

Increasing the efficiency of the material used is potentially the most successful

strategy to offset the demand for PV metals, and recycling will have a smaller

impact on demand because the lifespan of solar PV panels is long and their potential

for recycling is low. Although the increased demand for silver by 2050 will not be

as extreme as that for cobalt or lithium, it will still be considerable. This is important,

especially when considering that solar PV currently consumes approximately 9% of

end-use silver. It is possible to create silver-less solar panels, but these panels are

not expected to be on the market in the near future.

**Examination of the Climate Implications of Our Scenarios**

One of the Paris Agreement’s most outstanding achievements has been the consensus

by 195 countries to limit climate change to well below 2 °C and to pursue their best

efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C. Together with the goal to reduce emissions to net zero

levels, the international agreement clearly sets a framework in which regional and

national emission trajectories can be designed and evaluated. The strong focus on a

<2.0 °C temperature increase is partly driven by the knowledge that 2 °C warming

does not equate to a safe climate: not for small islands that are threatened by rising

seas, not for farmers dependent on rainfall in drought-stricken areas and not for

communities that are threatened by extreme rainfall events or more intense cyclones.

Here, we use probabilistic methods to examine the scenarios that have been

developed to evaluate their implications for long-term temperature and sea-level

rises, using models and settings that are also used in the recent IPCC Special Report

on 1.5 °C warming. Our lowest scenario has—by design—an approximate 50% or

higher chance of a 2100 temperature level that is below 1.5 °C—after a slight over-

shoot. In contrast to the SSP1_19 scenario, which is the main 1.5  °C-compliant

scenario in the next IPCC Assessment Report, our 1.5 °C Scenario does not rely on

massive net negative emissions. Even the most stringent mitigation scenarios devel-

oped in this study are unable to halt sea-level rise. In fact, a 30 cm rise in sea level

by 2100, which will continue thereafter, seems to be the unavoidable legacy of our

past use of fossil fuels, unless we remove this CO[^2]: from the atmosphere in much
larger amounts than even the complete reforestation of the planet would permit.

Faced with the grim challenge of ongoing climate risks on the one side and the
many positive effects and economic benefits of switching from fossil fuels to
renewables on the other, the path is clear. A rapid shift towards a new era of smart,
renewable and sector-coupled energy supply, combined with clever demand-side
measures and adaptations to the impacts of climate change, will allow us and our
children to address the legacy of our past reliance on fossil fuels.

The Paris Climate Agreement aims to hold global warming to well below 2.0 °C and

to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5 °C. To accomplish this, countries have submitted

Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020

climate actions (Rogelj et al. [^2016]:). The aim of this research is to develop practical

pathways to achieve the Paris climate goals in an economically feasible and sustain-

able matter.

The study described in this book focuses on changing the ways in which humans

produce energy, because energy-related CO[^2]: emissions are the main driver of cli-
mate change. The analysis also considers the developmental pathways of non-

energy-related emissions and mitigation measures because it is essential to address
their contributions if we are to achieve the Paris climate change targets. The analysis
considers options or ‘scenarios’ for the transition to net zero emissions across all
sectors that allow unnecessary techno-economic, societal, and environmental risks
to be avoided.
Scenario studies are an important way of linking expected or assumed anthropo-
genic activities and their resulting emissions with environmental effects, such as
global warming. They also provide important insights into these techno-economic,
societal, and political options and their various effects. Therefore, they are widely
used to analyse possible carbon emission pathways, to guide decision-makers, and
to motivate or justify interventions and developments. However, comprehensive,
transparent, and robust results and conclusions are required as the bases for such
decision-making. Ideally, this information will come from scenario studies that
investigate a broad range of possible conditions and available options. Such studies
must adopt a holistic approach and integrate comprehensive state-of-the-art back-
ground knowledge, including about the impacts of sectoral and technological
changes, the influence of market developments, and the effects of certain pathways.
Existing global scenario studies do not provide a comprehensive view of the pos-
sible development pathways and technological options required to achieve these
ambitious climate targets. Each study usually provides a few selected pathways,
representing a narrow range of possible energy futures. One reason for this is that
most scenario models are based on objective cost-optimizing functions, which over-
emphasize the cost efficiency based on uncertain cost assumptions. Another reason
is that disruptive developments are not usually considered in scenario narratives.
The history of scenario-based systems analysis is littered with many examples of
misleading and fallacious ‘optimized’ scenario pathways and derived policy recom-
mendations (see e.g., Mai et al. [^2013]:; Mohn [^2016]:).

_common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in_
_the light of different national circumstances._

Furthermore, in most existing 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C scenarios, achievement of the

climate targets is based on technologies that have significant, and to some extent

unknown, disadvantages. These technologies include nuclear power generation, car-

bon capture and sequestration, and geoengineering (see e.g., Rogelj et  al. [^2018]:;

Kriegler et al. [^2015]:). Such scenarios involve considerable risk. Moreover, the reader

is usually given only limited access to the model assumptions and results, and

therefore has limited information about the transparency and traceability of the fac-

tors that influence these model-based analyses and the conclusions drawn from them.

The primary objective of this report is to provide a holistic picture of what will

be involved in the transition to 100% renewable energy. This report examines power,

heat, and fuel supplies on a global scale. Its main focus is on the role of efficiency

and renewable energies. We aim to contribute a different and complementary view

of the global transition to renewable energy. We provide two exemplary develop-

ment pathways for each of the 10 regions of the world. We consider both pathways

to be achievable, based on the current state of knowledge, and both are consistent

with the “well below 2.0 °C” climate target.

```
In addition to scenario building, we assess the major economic and infrastruc-
```

tural implications of the two pathways in comparison with a 5.0 °C ‘reference’ sce-

nario based on the International Energy Agency (IEA)‘s Current Policies scenario

published in the _Word Energy Outlook 2017_ (IEA-WEO [^2017]:). We do not claim that

our scenarios are optimal with regard to the economy or society. We want to provide

a transparent basis for the further concretization and development of energy system

transformation, and to demonstrate the enormous challenges we face and the need

for action. In contrast to most other studies, we have excluded options with large

uncertainties about the economic, societal, and environmental risks associated with

technologies such as nuclear power, unsustainable biomass use, CCS, and

geoengineering.

Another important objective is to combine bottom-up energy scenarios with non-

energy greenhouse gas (GHG)-mitigation scenarios to construct a complete picture

of possible climate mitigation pathways and the contributions of the illustrated strat-

egies to achieving the Paris targets. Land-use changes and emissions of other GHGs

and aerosols are the focus of this analysis. Finally, GHG concentrations, radiative

forcing, and the implications of global mean temperature and sea-level rises are

modelled by applying a feasible model with reduced complexity, which is fre-

quently used for integrated assessment models, as the climate model.

```
Any scenario building on a global scale must severely simplify the complex tran-
```

sition processes and their interrelations. The introduction of different new technolo-

gies occurs under very different conditions and at different scales, and an in-depth

analysis is required in each case to identify the optimal or feasible solutions. Global

governance will also be required for the fast and deep decarbonisation of the world’s

energy systems, especially in relation to carbon pricing and efficiency standards.

However, all perspectives need a common understanding of what is required to

meet the ambitious Paris climate targets. We believe that the results of this study

will contribute to such a common understanding and will demonstrate how urgent is

the need to act.

[^1]: Introduction

The 2.0  °C Scenario represents a far more likely pathway than the 1.5  °C

Scenario. Whereas the 2.0 °C Scenario takes into account unavoidable delays due to

political, economic, and societal processes and stakeholders, the 1.5  °C Scenario

requires immediate action. Under the 1.5  °C Scenario, efficiency measures and

renewable energy options must be deployed, and the further development of energy

services must be limited and constrained. Furthermore, for the 1.5 °C Scenario to be

achievable, it will be essential for developing countries to avoid inefficient tech-

nologies and behaviours.

**Abstract** This chapter sets the context for the climate and energy scenario develop-

ment. The first part summarizes the scientific status quo of climate change research

and explains how the global climate has changed over recent decades and the likely

outcomes if we continue with business as usual and fail to drastically reduce GHG

emissions.

The second part reviews the development of the global energy markets during the

past decade. Trends in the power-, transport- and heating sector in regard to technolo-

gies and investments are provided for the year of writing (2018). The developments

put the energy scenarios presented in the following chapters into a global context.

**2.1 Scientific Status Quo of Climate Change Research**

A summary of the latest scientific publications explains how the global climate has

changed in recent decades and the likely outcomes if we continue with ‘business as

usual’ and fail to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**2.1.1 Basics of Climate Change and Radiative Forcing**

The Earth’s current climate is the result of a delicate balance between incoming short-

wave solar radiation and outgoing long-wave radiation that moves back to space.

Roughly half (165 W/m[^2]) the incoming short-wave radiation (340 W/m[^2]) reaches the

surface of the Earth. The rest is reflected back to space by clouds, aerosol particles, or
scattering gases, such as N[^2]: and O[^2]: (100  W/m[^2]) or is absorbed by the troposphere
(75 W/m[^2]) (Stephens et al. [^2012]:). With the exception of clouds and aerosols, this win-
dow to incoming solar radiation onto Earth’s surface is relatively transparent, so that
most of the Sun’s energy that comes towards Earth is absorbed either in the atmosphere
or on the Earth’s surface. This window is our basic heating engine, and the incoming
radiation that is our energy source is somewhat dimmed by aerosol emissions and by
changes in the amount of sunlight reflected back to space by changes in land use.
However, these are not humanity’s greatest influences on the Earth’s climate.
There is a second window for radiation, through which outgoing long-wave radi-
ation passes, and we are much more effectively closing this window than the one for
incoming solar radiation. We can imagine that this second atmospheric window
already has a thick curtain across it, largely formed by water vapour. That curtain
prevents surface long-wave radiation from going directly to space. In other words,
that curtain acts like a thick blanket. The long-wave radiation that the Earth loses
back into space originates not from its surface but from much higher atmospheric
layers, which tend to be colder. Without absorbers of long-wave radiation in the
atmosphere, the Earth’s surface would be much colder and inhospitable to humans.
To the parts of the outgoing radiation window that are not yet covered by water
vapour, humanity is now adding more layers of absorbers of other long-wave radia-
tion in the form of GHGs. By adding an assortment of GHGs, we are thickening the
existing curtain and closing the curtain further across the long-wave radiation win-
dow. Compared with the overall incoming solar radiation at 340 W/m[^2], the ‘curtain’

generated by human-induced increases in the concentrations of long-lived green-

house gases (CO[^2]:, CH[^4]:, halocarbons, N[^2]:O and fluorinated gases) appears to be of
little importance, as it “only” amounts to 2.83 W/m[^2]. The addition and subtraction

of many other smaller human influences results in a slightly reduced net current
(year 2011) forcing of 2.29 W/m[^2].

**2.1.1.1 Anthropogenic Contribution**

Beyond reasonable doubt, climate change over the last 250 years has been driven by
anthropogenic activities. In fact, the human-induced release of GHGs into the atmo-
sphere has the potential to cause more than 100% of the currently observed climate
change. The reason that climate change is not even greater than it is that some
human-induced changes mask some of the warming attributable to elevated GHG
concentrations. This masking effect arises from the emission of cooling aerosols
and changes in land use that increase the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface.

**2.1.1.2 Carbon Budget and Future Warming**

Although the anthropogenic contribution to climate change occurs via a large set of
GHG emissions (the current emission scenarios that feed into CMIP6 include 43
GHG emission species), and multiple aerosols and land-use changes, there is one
dominant influence: carbon dioxide (CO[^2]:) emissions.

```

It is not only the magnitude of the anthropogenic emissions of CO[^2]: that makes it
such a significant driver of human-induced climate change. There is also an inherent
difference between CO[^2]: and almost all other GHGs and aerosols. Over the time
scales of interest here, CO[^2]: does not have a finite lifetime in the atmosphere. All
other gases react chemically, become photo-dissociated in the stratosphere, or are,
for example, consumed by the bacteria in soils. However, once CO[^2]: is released from
the near-permanent carbon pools of fossil fuel reservoirs, it only travels between a

set of ‘active’ carbon pools. These active pools are the land biosphere, the ocean,

and the atmosphere. Therefore, if CO[^2]: is added to one, the level in all three pools
will rise and over time, a new, higher equilibrium concentration is reached. For

example, whereas CO[^2]: is consumed by plants during the photosynthesis process and
then built into plant tissue as carbon, this same carbon is released again as CO2
when forests burn, when organic matter in the soil decomposes, and when humans
and other animals oxidize the food they eat. Therefore, a kilogram of CO[^2]: emissions
will increase the atmospheric CO[^2]: concentration for hundreds or even thousands of
years. Initially, the average CO[^2]: concentration will shoot up by that kilogram, and
then drop relatively quickly again before a new equilibrium is slowly re-established
by the redistribution of carbon into the land biosphere and the ocean.
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report highlighted this key difference between CO2
and other GHGs. The airborne fraction of CO[^2]: emissions diminishes over time, as
for other GHGs. However, the airborne CO[^2]: fraction does not decline to zero over
100 years, 1000 years, or even longer periods. Furthermore, carbon-cycle feedback
mechanisms mean that higher CO[^2]: concentrations cause more carbon to remain in
the atmosphere. Acting in the other direction, any extra amount of CO[^2]: in the atmo-
sphere will have less and less effect on radiative forcing, i.e., how much each CO2
molecule contributes to the warming of the planet. These factors act in concert with
another feature of the climate system: the Earth’s inertia to warming. When the
thermostat of your kitchen oven is set to 220 °C, the oven will take a while to heat
to that level. The situation is much the same with the Earth’s climate. The IPCC
Fifth Assessment Report notes that three effects (the carbon cycle and its feedbacks,
the saturation effect of forcing, and the delayed response of the atmosphere to
warming) combine to create what is almost a stepwise function in the warming
caused by CO[^2]: emissions. In other words, every extra kilogram of CO[^2]: produces a
slightly greater increase in temperature than the preceding kilogram, and the warm-
ing effect is much the same 10 years after the emission of that kilogram as it is after
100 or 500 years. Over time, less of the CO[^2]: will remain in the atmosphere, but the
Earth’s inertia will still cause the temperature to reflect the extra warmth arising
from the initial emission.
This feature of the Earth’s warming and the carbon cycle can be exploited to
derive a very simple linear relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and
warming. In fact, the resultant warming is a simple function of the sum of all the
CO[^2]: that has ever been emitted, largely independent of when a certain amount of
CO[^2]: was emitted in the past. Based on this understanding, we can compute the car-
bon budgets for specific levels of warming. As a complication, of course, an
unknown amount of warming arises in response to other GHG emissions and aero-

sols. When deriving carbon budgets, this extra level of warming is normally derived
from a range of future emission scenarios. Therefore, the ultimate level of warming
is the sum of the linear CO[^2]:-induced warming level (often described as the ‘tran-
sient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon’) and a smaller and some-
what uncertain contribution that depends on the other GHGs and aerosols.

**2.1.2 Carbon Budgets for 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Warming**

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report used the results of earth system models to derive
its carbon budgets. Earth system models are the most complex computer models we
have of how the Earth, its atmosphere, oceans, and vegetation are interacting with
each other. The IPCC investigated the amounts of cumulative carbon emissions (in
a multi-gas world) that would be consistent with, for example, temperatures main-
tained below either 1.5 °C or 2.0 °C higher than to pre-industrial levels. The recently
published IPCC Special Report on the 1.5  °C degree target cites different carbon
budget numbers, depending on whether a low estimate of historical temperatures is
assumed or surface air temperatures are consistently applied. Therefore, there is
some complexity and uncertainty around the carbon budget, which is related to the
fact that different interpretations can be made about how far we are still away from
the 1.5 °C target (for example). If we assume that we are still 0.63 °C away from
1.5 °C warming (a very optimistic estimate, which is unfortunately based on a too
optimistic account of historical emissions), from January 2018 onwards, we can still
emit 1320 GtCO[^2]: before reaching 2.0  °C warming (66% chance) and 770 GtCO2
before reaching 1.5 °C warming (50% chance). These figures must be reduced by a
further 100 GtCO[^2]: to account for the additional Earth system feedback that has
occurred over the twenty-first century. However, when a more realistic measure of

historical temperature evolution is used (i.e., calculated by consistently using prox-

ies for surface air temperatures over the land and ocean, rather than by mixing ocean

surface water temperatures with air temperatures over land), the carbon budgets are

no longer very high. Specifically, the carbon budget required to maintain the Earth’s

temperature below 2.0  °C, with 66% probability, then decreases to 1170 GtCO2

from 1 January 2018 onwards and to 560 GtCO2 for a 50% chance of staying below

1.5  °C (before the extra 100 GtCO2 that must be subtracted for additional Earth

system feedbacks is taken into account; see Table 2.2 in the IPCC Special Report on

1.5 °C warming).

```
The substantial difference between these two sets of figures (and also their dif-
```

ferences from earlier IPCC estimates of the carbon budget) is the focus of a current

intense scientific debate, which is unlikely to be settled in the next few months (see

e.g., Schurer et al. [^2017]:, [^2018]:; Hawkins et al. [^2017]:). As already mentioned, one of

the key factors in deriving a carbon budget is the estimated current level of warm-

ing. Among other reasons, the recent warming ‘hiatus’ in temperature may explain

why the recently derived carbon budgets are more relaxed than expected. When the

‘hiatus’ period substantially influences the level of warming that is taken as a start-

ing point, the ‘distance’ from 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C might seem larger than it is. The

recent upswing in the global mean temperatures gives us an idea of how much natu-

ral variability is superimposed on the long-term warming trend. Other points for

discussion in the determination of carbon budgets include the pre-industrial warm-

ing level and the already-mentioned amount of warming induced by non-CO[^2]: gases.
This study does not aim to resolve the differences in opinions about carbon bud-

gets, but it does provide emissions pathways that can be considered to be consistent
with both a target level of 1.5 °C warming in the case of the 1.5 °C scenario, and
with a “well-below 2.0 °C” target level in the case of the 2.0 °C scenario.
Whatever the precise carbon budget, recent effects of climate change provide
another set of stark reminders that it is more urgent than ever to replace fossil fuels.
If we wait for the wild-fire seasons that will occur at global warming levels of
1.5 °C or 2.0 °C, with intensified droughts or ever-more intense hurricane, it might
be much too late to avoid their widespread catastrophic impacts. Even at 1.5  °C
warming, there is a risk that the continuous melting of the Greenland ice sheet will
cause sea levels to rise by meters over the coming centuries. Fossil fuels have
undoubtedly allowed great growth in prosperity across the globe, but their replace-
ment with the cleaner, cheaper and emission-free technologies that are available
today is overdue.

**2.2 Development of Energy Markets—Past and Present**

Renewable energy technologies have been developing rapidly since the beginning

of the century, and they have emerged from niche markets to become mainstream.

This section provides an overview of the development of renewable energy in the

power, heating, and transport sectors up to the year of writing (2018). These devel-

opments will put the energy scenarios presented in the following chapters into a

global context. The research and data in Sect. 2.2.1 are based on the REN21

Renewables 2018—Global Status Report Renewables.

**2.2.1 Global Trends in Renewable Energy in 2018**

In 2017, ongoing trends continued: solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power domi-

nated the global market for new power plants, the price of renewable energy tech-

nologies continued to decline, and fossil fuel prices remained low. A new benchmark

was reached, in that the new renewable capacity began to compete favourably with

existing fossil fuel power plants in some markets (Malik [^2017]:). Electrification of

the transport and heating sectors is gaining attention, and although the amount of

electrification is currently small, the use of renewable technologies is expected to

increase significantly.

[^2]: State of Research

The growth in solar PV has been remarkable, nearly double that of second-

ranking wind power, and the capacity of new solar PV is greater than the combined

increases in the coal, gas, and nuclear capacities (FS-UNEP [^2018]:). Storage is

increasingly used in combination with variable renewables as battery costs decline,

and solar PV plus storage has started to compete with gas peaking plants (Carroll

[^2018]:). However, bioenergy (including traditional biomass) remains the leading

renewable energy source in the heating (buildings and industry) and transport

sectors.

Renewable energy’s share of the total final energy consumption has increased

only modestly in recent years, despite tremendous growth in the modern renewable

energy sector. There are two main reasons for this. One is that the growth in the

overall energy demand (except for the drop in 2009 after the global economic reces-

sion) has counteracted the strong forward momentum of modern renewable energy

technologies. The other is the declining share of traditional biomass, as people

switch to other forms of energy. Traditional biomass makes up nearly half of all

renewable energy used, and its use has increased at a rate lower than the growth in

total energy consumption.

Since 2013, the global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions from fossil fuels have
remained relatively flat. Early estimates based on preliminary data suggest that this
changed in 2017, with global CO[^2]: emissions growing by around 1.4% (REN21-
GSR [^2018]:). These increased emissions were primarily due to increased coal con-
sumption in China, which grew by 3.7% in 2017 after a 3-year decline (ENERDATA
[^2018]:). This increased Chinese consumption, as well as steady growth of around 4%
in India, is expected to lead to an upturn in global coal use, reversing the annual
global decline observed from 2013 to 2016 (ENERDATA [^2018]:).
In contrast to the upturn in global coal use, in 2017, 26 countries joined the
Powering Past Coal Alliance, which is committed to phasing-out coal power by
2030, with new pledges from Angola, Denmark, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom (Carrington [^2017]:). An increasing number of companies who
owned, developed or operated coal power plants have moved away from the coal
business (Shearer [^2017]:). Also in 2017, 26 of 28 European Union member states
signed an agreement to build no more coal-fired power plants from 2020 onwards,
and the Port of Amsterdam, which currently handles 16 million tonnes of coal per
year, announced plans to become coal-free by 2030 (Campbell [^2017]:).
The global oil price averaged USD 52.5 per barrel in 2017, equivalent to about
half the record high prices that occurred between 2011 and 2014, although it was
still almost double the prices from 1996 to 2005 (Statista [^2018]:). Natural gas prices
fell from 2013 to 2016, and early indicators suggest that prices remained low or
decreased further in 2017 (BP [^2017]:). Low fossil fuel prices have challenged renew-
able energy markets, especially in the heating and transport sectors (IEA-RE [^2016]:).
The value of direct global fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 2016 was esti-
mated to be about USD 360 billion, a 15% reduction since 2015—but still more
than 20% higher than the total renewable industry turnover in 2017 (IEA-WEB

[^2018]:). The value of fossil fuel subsidies also increases by an order of magnitude if
externalities are considered (IMF [^2015]:). Although the Group of Twenty (G20) reaf-
firmed their 2009 commitment to phasing-out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies in
2017, progress has been slow and there are calls from large investors, insurers, and
civil society to both increase transparency and accelerate the process (G20-[^2017]:).
The main problems identified include that the G20 has not defined ‘inefficient sub-
sidies’; there is no mandatory reporting; and there are no timelines for phase-out
commitments (Asmelash [^2017]:).
At the global policy level, international climate negotiations have continued to
influence energy markets. Following the 2015 Paris Agreement of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a technical meet-
ing on its implementation took place in Bonn, Germany, in November 2017 at the
23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23) (UNFCCC [^2017]:). Although renewable
energy figured prominently in a large proportion of the Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) that countries submitted in the lead-up to COP22 in 2016, the
climate negotiations in 2017 were unable to resolve the question of how NDCs
should be organized, delivered, and updated, leaving uncertainty about how national
renewable energy commitments could be ramped up (Timberley [^2017]:).
Despite these uncertainties, an increasing number of communities, cities, and
regions have introduced 100% renewable energy targets. The number of cities pow-
ered by at least 70% renewable electricity has more than doubled in 2 years, from
42 in 2015 to 101 in 2017. These cities now include Auckland, Brasilia, Nairobi,
and Oslo (CDP-WEB [^2018]:).
Carbon pricing policies, which include carbon taxes and emission trading
schemes, were in place in 64 jurisdictions around the world in 2017, up from 61 in
[^2016]:_._ In December 2017 (REN21-GSR [^2018]:), China launched the first phase of its
long-awaited nationwide carbon emissions trading scheme, which will focus on the
power sector. Carbon trading will be based in Shanghai and will include about 1700
power companies emitting more than 3 billion tonnes of CO[^2]: annually (Xu and
Mason [^2017]:). For comparison, the emissions trading scheme of the European Union

included around 1.7 billion tonnes of CO[^2]: in 2016 (EC[^2017]). Reforms to the
European Union scheme were agreed upon at the end of 2017, which will reduce the

number of emission certificates issued and accelerate the cancellation of surplus
certificates (Agora [^2018]:).
The global investment in renewable energy in 2017 (excluding hydropower
plants larger than 50 megawatts [MW]) was USD 280 billion (REN21-GSR [^2018]:),
up by 2% from 2016, but 13% below the all-time high, which occurred in 2015. It
is noteworthy that each dollar represents more capacity on the ground as prices per
GW decrease. Nearly all the investment was in either solar PV (58%) or wind power
(38%). Developing countries accounted for the largest share of investment for the
third consecutive year, at 63% of the total investment. China alone accounted for
45% of global investment, with a 30% increase since 2016. The United States was
next, with 14%, followed by Japan (5%) and India (4%). Investment remained
steady or trended upwards in Latin America and the USA, but has been falling in
Europe since about 2010, with a drop of 30% from 2016 to 2017 (UNEP-FS [^2018]:).

Pressure to diversify and stable growth in the renewables sector over the past

decade has increased the interest of the fossil fuel industry in renewables. Large oil

corporations more than doubled their acquisitions, project investments, and venture

capital stakes in renewable energy in 2016 relative to those in 2015. This increased

the investment in clean energy companies to USD 6.2 billion over the past 15 years,

with more than 70% of deals involving solar PV or wind, and 16% involving biofu-

els (Bloomberg [^2017]:). However, this is dwarfed by the spending of these companies

on fossil fuels. One estimate is that renewables account for about 3% of the total

annual spending (around USD 100 billion) by the world’s five biggest oil companies

(Schneyer and Bousso [^2018]:). Bank finance for fossil fuels increased in 2017 by

11% relative to that in 2016, after a significant decline in 2016 (RAN [^2018]:).

In 2017, as in previous years, renewables saw the greatest increases in capacity

in the power sector, whereas the growth of renewables in the heating, cooling, and

transport sectors was comparatively slow. Sector coupling—the interconnection of

power, heating, and transport, and particularly the electrification of heating and

transport—is gaining increasing attention as a way to increase the uptake of renew-

ables by the transport and thermal sectors. Sector coupling also allows the integra-

tion of large shares of variable renewable energy, although this is still at an early

stage. For example, China is specifically encouraging the electrification of heating,

manufacturing, and transport in high-renewable areas, including promoting the use

of renewable electricity for heating to reduce the curtailment of wind, solar PV, and

hydropower. Several USA states are examining options for electrification, specifi-

cally to increase the overall renewable energy share (NEEP [^2017]:).

**2.2.1.1 Trends in the Renewable Power Sector**

The capacity for generating renewable power saw its largest annual increase ever in

2017, with an estimated 178 GW of capacity added. The total global renewable

power capacity increased by almost 9% relative to that in 2016. Solar PV additions

reached a record high and represented about 55% of newly installed renewable

power capacity in 2017. The increase in the solar PV capacity was greater than the

combined net additions to the fossil fuel and nuclear capacities. For the first time,

the installed solar PV capacity surpassed the global operating capacity of nuclear

power. Wind and hydropower installations were in second and third positions, con-

tributing about 29% and 11% of the increase in renewable generation capacity,

respectively (REN21-GSR [^2018]:).

In 2017, renewables accounted for an estimated 70% of net additions to the

global power-generating capacity, up from 63% in 2016 (REN21-GSR [^2018]:). The

cost-competitiveness of renewable power generation continued to improve. Wind

power and solar PV are now competitive with the generation of new fossil fuel

energy in many markets, and even with existing fossil fuel generation in some mar-

kets. The costs of bio-electricity, hydropower, and geothermal power projects com-

missioned in 2017 were mostly within the range of the cost of fossil-fuel-fired

electricity generation. Offshore wind prices also fell significantly in 2017, as com-

petitive tenders in Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands resulted in bids that were
competitive with new conventional power generation.
By the end of 2017, the countries with the greatest total installed renewable elec-
tric capacities were China, the USA, Brazil, Germany, and Canada. When only solar
and wind capacities are considered, the top countries were China, the USA, and
Germany, followed by Japan, India, and Italy, and then by Spain and the UK, which
had about equal amounts of capacity by the year’s end.
Seventeen countries have more than 90% renewable electricity, with the majority
supplied almost completely by hydropower. However, three of these, Uruguay,
Costa Rica, and Ethiopia, also have significant contributions from wind power
(32%, 10%, and 7%, respectively) (REN21-GSR [^2018]:). Increasing proportions of
variable renewable electricity (VRE) must be integrated into electricity systems,
and VRE penetration reached locally significant levels in 2017. The countries lead-
ing the way with wind and solar penetration are Denmark (52%), Uruguay (32%),
and Cape Verde (31%), with another three countries at or above the 25% VRE pen-
etration mark. Several countries and regions integrated much higher shares of VRE
into their energy systems as instantaneous shares of the total demand for short peri-
ods during 2017, e.g., South Australia (more than 100% of load from wind power
alone, and 44% of load from solar PV alone on another occasion), Germany (66%
of load from wind and solar combined), Texas (54% of load from wind alone), and
Ireland (60% of load from wind alone) (Parkinson [^2017]:).
Curtailment—the forced reduction of wind and solar generation—is an indicator
of grid integration challenges. In six of the jurisdictions with the highest VRE pen-
etration, the curtailment rates were low (0–6%) in 2016 (Wynn [^2018]:). Although
curtailment initially tends to increase as the VRE share increases, some jurisdictions
have successfully introduced measures, such as transmission upgrades, that have
significantly reduced curtailment (Wynn [^2018]:). Integration challenges have led to
high curtailment rates in China, the world’s largest wind and solar PV market (ECNS.
CN [^2018]:). These were reduced in 2017, with the average curtailment of wind power
for the year at around 12%, down from 17% in 2016, and the average curtailment of
solar PV was 6–7%, down 4.3% relative to that in 2016 (Haugwitz [^2018]:).
The ongoing increase in the growth and geographic expansion of renewable
energy was driven by the continued decline in the prices for renewable energy
technologies (in particular, for solar PV and wind power), caused by the increasing
power demand in some countries and by targeted renewable energy support mecha-
nisms.[^44] Solar PV and onshore wind power are now competitive with new fossil fuel

generation in an increasing number of locations, due in part to declines in system

component prices and to improvements in generation efficiency. The bid prices for

offshore wind power also dropped significantly in Europe during 2016 (FT

12.9.[^2017]:).

Such declines in cost are particularly important in developing and emerging

economies, and in isolated electric systems (such as on islands or in isolated rural

communities) where electricity prices tend to be high (if they are not heavily subsi-

dized), where there is a shortage of generation, and where renewable energy

resources are particularly plentiful, making renewable electricity more competitive

relative to other options. Many developing countries are racing to bring new power-

generating capacities online to meet rapidly increasing electricity demands, often

turning to renewable technologies (which may be grid-connected or off-grid)

through policies such as tendering or feed-in tariffs, in order to achieve the desired

growth quickly.

Approximately 1.06 billion people, most in sub-Saharan Africa, lived without

electricity in 2016, 223 million fewer than in 2012 (IEA-WEO [^2016]:; IEA-EAO

[^2017]:). Distributed renewables for energy access (DREA) systems were serving an

estimated 300 million people at the end of 2016, and they comprised about 6% of

new electricity connections worldwide between 2012 and 2016 (IRENA-P [^2017]:). In

places where the electricity grid does not reach or is unreliable, DREA technologies

provide a cost-effective option to improve energy access. For example, about 13%

of the population of Bangladesh gained access to electricity through solar home

systems (SHS), and more than 50% of the off-grid population in Kenya is served by

DREA systems (Dahlberg [^2018]:). Off-grid solar devices, such as solar lanterns and

SHS, displayed annual growth rates of 60% between 2013 and 2017 (Dahlberg

[^2018]:).

**2.2.1.2 Heating and Cooling**

Energy use for heating and cooling is estimated to have accounted for just over half

of the total world final energy consumption in 2017, with about half of that used for

industrial process heat (IEA-RE [^2017]:). Around 27% of this was supplied by renew-

ables. The largest share of renewable heating was from traditional biomass, which

continued to supply about 16.4% of the global heat demand, predominantly for

cooking in the developing world (IEA-RE [^2017]:). Renewable energy—excluding

traditional biomass—supplied approximately 9% of the total global heat production

in 2017, up from about 6% in 2008 (REN21-GSR [^2018]:).

Renewable heating and cooling receives much less attention than renewable

power generation, and has been identified as the ‘sleeping giant of energy policy’

for the past decade (IEA-Collier [^2018]:). The use of modern renewable heat has

increased at an average rate close to 3% per year since 2008, gradually increasing

its share of heat supply, but it lags well behind the average annual increase of 17%

in modern renewables for electricity (IEA-RE [^2017]:). Renewable energy technolo-

gies for heating and cooling include a variety of solar thermal collectors for differ-

ent temperature levels; geothermal and air-sourced heat pumps; bioenergy used in

traditional combustion applications or converted to gaseous, liquid, or solid fuels

and subsequently used for heat; and any type of renewable electricity used for heat-

ing. Heat may be supplied by on-site equipment or by a district heating network.

A wide range of temperature requirements exist, from temperatures of around

40–70  °C for space and water heating in buildings, to steam at several hundred

degrees Celsius for some industrial processes (Averfalk et  al. [^2017]:; USA-EPA

[^2017]:). The variety in renewable heating systems and applications is much greater

than in the renewable power sector, which makes standardization to reduce costs by

economies of scale more challenging, and makes it difficult for policy makers to

find effective mechanisms to increase the renewable share. Trends in the use of

modern renewable energy for heating vary according to the technology, although

the relative shares of the main renewable heat technologies have remained stable for

the past few years. In 2017, bioenergy (excluding traditional biomass) accounted for

the greatest share, providing an estimated 68% of renewable heat, followed by

renewable electricity at 18%, solar thermal at around 7%, district heating at 4%

(which was nearly all bioenergy), and geothermal at 2% (REN21-GSR [^2018]:).

Although additional bio-heat and solar thermal capacities were added in 2017, the

growth in both markets continued to slow. The trends in direct geothermal heating

are unclear.

Bioenergy systems provide individual heating in residential and medium-sized

office buildings, either as stand-alone systems or in addition to an existing central

heating system, and bioenergy also accounts for 95% of district heating (IEA-RE

[^2017]:). District heating systems are suitable for use in densely populated regions

with an annual heating demand during ≥4 months of the year, such as in the north-

ern part of China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Poland, Russia, Sweden, the UK, and

the northern United States (IRENA-RE-H [^2017]:). However, district heating supplies

a very small proportion of global heating needs. The majority of district heating

systems are fuelled by either coal or gas, with the share of renewables ranging from

0% to 42% (IRENA-RE-H [^2017]:). Switching existing districting heating systems

from fossil fuels to renewables has considerable potential (IRENA-RE-H [^2017]:).

Since the 1980s, Sweden has progressively switched from an almost entirely fossil-

fuelled heating supply to systems supplied by 90% renewables and recycled heat

(Brown [^2018]:). District heating can combine different sources of heat, and can play

a positive role in the integration of VRE through the use of electric heat pumps.

Solar thermal collector installations continued to decline globally in 2017, with

a reduction of 3% (REN21-GSR [^2018]:) compared with 2016, but the markets in

China and India remained strong. In Europe, hybrid systems, in which solar thermal

systems are used in combination with gas-fired central heating or bioenergy, are

becoming more common, with specialized companies offering standardized

technology.

```
Electricity accounts for an estimated 6% of the total heating and cooling con-
```

sumption in buildings and industry, with about half of that electricity estimated to

be renewable (IEA-RE [^2017]:). The further electrification of heating and cooling

drew increasing attention in 2017, particularly in the United States and China.

Residential solar PV systems are also increasingly connected to electricity-using

heat pumps in buildings rather than feeding the energy into the public electricity

grid, especially when feed-in tariffs for solar electricity are reduced or have been

entirely phased out.

Space cooling accounts for about 2% (REN21-GSR [^2018]:) of the total world final
energy consumption, and is supplied almost entirely by electricity (IEA-RE [^2017]:).
Solar-based space-cooling systems are still in the minority compared with conven-
tional air-conditioning systems.

**2.2.1.3 Transport**

The global energy demand for transport increased by an average of 2.1% between

2000 and 2016, and is responsible for approximately 29% of the final global energy

use and 24% of GHG emissions (IEA-WEO [^2017]:). The vast majority (92%) of

global transport energy needs are met by oil, with small proportions met by biofuels

(2.9%) and electricity (1.4%) (IEA-WEO [^2017]:).

There are three main entry points for renewable energy in the transport sector:

the use of 100% liquid biofuels or biofuels blended with conventional fuels; natural

gas vehicles and infrastructure (these can run on upgraded biogas); and the electri-

fication of transport (if the electricity is itself renewable), which can be via batteries

or hydrogen in fuel cells.

Biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) make by far the greatest contribution to

renewable transport. The overall renewable share of road transport energy use was

estimated to be 4.2% in 2016, with nearly all of that from biofuels (IEA-RE [^2017]:).

In 2017, global bioethanol production increased by 2.5% relative to that in 2016,

with a slight decline in Brazil offset by increases in the USA, Europe, and China

(IEA OIL [^2018]:). Biodiesel production remained relatively stable in 2017, following

a 9% increase in 2016 relative to 2015 (IEA OIL [^2018]:).

```
The technology for producing, purifying, and upgrading biogas for use in trans-
```

port is relatively mature, and the numbers of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) and the

associated infrastructure are increasing slowly but steadily internationally. Many

countries have relatively well-developed NGV infrastructures, and NGVs provide a

good entry point for biogas in the transport sector (IRENA-RV-[^2017]:). The largest

producers of biogas for vehicle fuel in 2016 were Germany, Sweden, Switzerland,

the UK, and the USA (IRENA-RV-[^2017]:). The main barriers to the further expansion

of biogas for transport are economic, with supply costs of USD 0.22–1.55 per cubic

metre (m[^3]), compared with natural gas prices, which are as low as USD 0.13 per m[^3].

However, the lack of consistent regulation and access to gas grids are also signifi-
cant barriers (IRENA-RV-2017).
Historically, the electrification of the transport sector has been limited to trains,
light rail, and some buses. In 2017, there were signs that the entire sector would
open to electrification. Fully electric passenger cars, scooters, and bicycles are rap-
idly becoming common-place, and prototypes for heavy-duty trucks, planes, and
ships were released in 2017 (Hawkins [^2017]:).
The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road passed the three million mark
in 2017 (Guardian 25.12.[^2017]:). Annual sales are still only a very small proportion
of the global total (1%), but this is set to change. In 2017, partly influenced by the
scandal over diesel emissions cheating, five countries announced their intention to
ban sales of new diesel and petrol cars from 2030 (India, the Netherlands, and
Slovenia) or 2040 (France and the UK) (Bloomberg 11.[^2017]:). The announcement
of electric product lines by car manufacturers in 2017 was another breakthrough.
However, the number of EVs on the road is dwarfed by the number of electric bikes.

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

The global fleet was estimated to be around 200 million at the end of 2016, most of

them in China, and 30% of bicycles sold in the Netherlands were e-bikes in 2017

(Wang [^2017]:). Electric two- and three-wheel vehicles account for less than 0.5% of

all transport energy use, but they account for most of the remaining renewable share

after biofuels (IEA-RE [^2017]:).

Further electrification of the transport sector will potentially create a new market

for renewable energy and ease the integration of variable renewable energy, if mar-

ket and policy settings ensure that the charging patterns are effectively harmonized

with the requirements of electricity systems. There are already examples of coun-

tries and cities supplying electricity for both heavy and light rail from renewable

electricity, including the Netherlands (BI [^2017]:), Delhi (Times of India [^2017]:), and

Santiago de Chile (CT [^2017]:).

Road transport accounts for 67% of global transport energy use, and two-thirds

of that is used for passenger transport.

Aviation accounts for around 11% of the total energy used in transport

(US-EIA-[^2017]:). In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization

(ICAO), a UN agency, announced a landmark agreement to mitigate GHG emis-

sions in the aviation sector. By the end of 2017, 106 states representing 90.8% of

global air traffic had settled on a global emissions reduction scheme (Guardian

6.10.[^2016]:). Together with technical and operational improvements, this agreement

will support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels, specifically drop-

in fuels produced from biomass and different types of waste (ICAO [^2018]:). In 2017,

Norway announced a target of 100% electric short-haul flights by 2040 (Guardian

18.1.[^2018]:).

Shipping consumes around 12% of the global energy used in transport

(US-EIA-[^2017]:) and is responsible for approximately 2.0% of global CO[^2]: emis-
sions. There are multiple entry points for renewable energy: ships can incorporate

wind (sails) and solar energy directly, and can use biofuels, synthetic fuels, or
hydrogen produced with renewable electricity for propulsion. China saw the launch
of the world’s first all-electric cargo ship in 2017, and in Sweden, two large ferries
were converted from diesel to electricity in 2017 (China Daily 14.11.[^2017]:). In 2017,
the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Marine Environment Protection
Committee (MEPC) approved a roadmap (2017–2023) to develop a strategy for
reducing GHG emissions from ships. The roadmap includes plans for an initial
GHG strategy to be adopted in 2018 (IMO [^2017]:).
Rail accounts for around 1.9% of the total energy used in transport and is the
most highly electrified transport sector. The share of rail transport powered by elec-
tricity was estimated to be 39% in 2015, up from 29% in 2005 (IEA-UIC [^2017]:). Just
over a third of the electricity (9% of rail energy) is estimated to be derived from
renewable sources (IEA-UIC [^2017]:). Some jurisdictions are opting to ensure that the
proportion of energy from renewable sources in their transport sectors is well above
the share of renewable energy in their power sectors. For example, the Dutch rail-

[^2]: State of Research

18

way company NS announced that its target to power all electric trains with 100%

renewable electricity was achieved ahead of schedule in 2017 (Caughill [^2017]:), and

the New South Wales Government in Australia announced a renewable tender for

the Sydney’s light rail system.

```
Following the historic Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015, the interna-
```

tional community has focused increasing attention on the decarbonisation of the

transport sector. At the climate conference in November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, a

multi-stakeholder alliance launched the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance (UN-P

[^2018]:). France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Costa Rica, and the Paris Process on

Mobility and Climate (PPMC) are members of the Alliance, which includes coun-

tries, cities, regions, and private-sector companies committed to ambitious action on

transport and climate change (UN-P [^2018]:).

**Abstract** A detailed overview of the methodologies used to develop the 2.0 °C and

1.5 °C scenario presented in this book. Starting with the overall modelling approach,

the interaction of seven different models is explained which are used to calculate

and developed detailed scenarios for greenhouse gas emission and energy pathways

to stay within a 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C global warming limit. The following models are

presented:

• For the non-energy GHG emission pathways, the _Generalized Equal Quantile_

```
Walk (GQW) method, the land-based sequestration design method and the
Carbon cycle and climate (MAGICC) model.
```

• For the energy pathways, a renewable energy resources assessment for space

```
constrained environments ([R]E-SPACE, the transport scenario model (TRAEM),
the Energy System Model (EM) and the power system model [R]E 24/7.
```

The methodologies of an employment analysis model, and a metal resource

assessment tool are outlined. These models have been used to examine the analysis

of the energy scenario results.

Achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCCC [^2015]:) will require
the total decarbonisation of the energy system by 2050, with a global emissions
peak no later than 2020 (Hare and Roming [^2016]:) and a drastic reduction in non-
energy-related greenhouse gases (GHGs), including land-use-related emissions
(Rogelj and den Elzen [^2016]:). Over the past decades, numerous computer models
have been developed to analyse different emissions pathways and to investigate the
effects of changes in policy and technology and adjustments in global and regional
economies. A wide range of climate models is used to calculate non-energy-related
GHG emissions pathways and their impacts on the global climate. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that “Climate models
have continued to be developed and improved since the AR4 [published in
2007-author], and many models have been extended into Earth System models by
including the representation of biogeochemical cycles important to climate change”
(Flato and Marotzke [^2013]:). Whereas climate models analyse the effects of a variety
of GHG emissions, energy scenarios only cover energy-related CO[^2]:. Their purpose
is to investigate future energy systems to identify feasible technological and/or eco-

nomic pathways. Like climate models, energy models are diverse and vary signifi-

cantly in their methodologies. The IPCC’s Special Report on Renewable Energy

Sources and Climate Change Mitigation states that there is “enormous variation in

the detail and structure of the models used to construct the scenarios” (Fischedick

and Schaeffer [^2011]:). Energy scenarios with high penetrations of variable renewable

power generation—solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power—require a higher

degree of time resolution to assess the security of 24/7 electricity supplies than

those with mainly dispatchable power generation.

Modelling the energy system involves a variety of methodological requirements,

which pose specific challenges when addressed on the global level: the quantitative

projection of developments in (future) technologies and potential markets; a consis-

tent database of renewable energy potentials and their temporal and spatial distribu-

tions; reliable data on the current situations in all regions; an assessment of energy

flows and emissions across all energy subsectors, such as industry, transport, resi-

dential, etc.; and a comprehensive assessment of all CO[^2]: emissions, in order to assess
the impact of the energy system on climate change. Finally, analysing and assessing

the energy transition require a long-term perspective on future developments.
Changes to energy markets require long-term decisions to be made because
infrastructural changes are potentially required, and are therefore independent of
short-term market developments. The power market cannot function optimally
without long-term infrastructure planning. Grid modifications and the roll-out of
smart metering infrastructure, for example, require several years to implement.
These technologies form the basis of the energy market and allow energy trading.
Therefore, the time required for infrastructure planning and other substantial trans-
formation processes must be considered in the scenario-building approach.
Although numerous energy scenarios that provide 100% renewable energy at the
community, state, and national levels have been published in the past decade
(Elliston and MacGill [^2014]:; Teske and Dominish [^2016]:; Klaus et al. [^2010]:; Teske and
Brown [^2012]:), only a handful of analyses have been performed on a global level. The
main research projects on 100% renewable energy supplies published between 2015
and 2018 were:

```

All the studies listed above share the same modelling horizon until 2050 and focus

clearly on the fast and massive deployment of renewable energy resources (RES).

Options with large uncertainties in terms of techno-economic, societal, and environ-

mental risks, such as large hydro power, nuclear power, or unsustainable biomass use,

carbon capture and storage (CCS), and geoengineering are excluded. However, each

of these studies has a specific strength. On the one hand, the analyses from Stanford

University and the University of Technology Lappeenranta include an hourly simula-

tion of power demand and supply, in addition to the pathway modelling. On the other

hand, the Energy [R]evolution study covers the complete energy sector, with detailed

insights into the heat and transport sectors. However, all these studies cover only CO2
emissions from the energy system, without further investigation of other GHG sources.

Therefore, our project combines these strengths into a single approach by com-
bining a set of models. The approach is based on the scenario modelling used for the
Energy [R]evolution scenario series developed by the authors between 2004 and

2015. It models scenarios of comprehensive pathways for power, heat, and fuel sup-
ply in 5-year steps, and includes specific insights from a transport model. The sce-
nario building is also complemented by a simulation with hourly resolution to
calculate the electricity storage demand and to increase the spatial resolution from
10 to 72 regions. Another significant improvement over existing studies is its com-
bination with a climate model. The interaction between non-energy GHG pathways
and a high-resolution integrated energy assessment model (IAM) provides addi-
tional information on how to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

**3.1 100% Renewable Energy—Modelling Approach**

The complete decarbonisation of the global energy supply requires entirely new

technical, economic, and policy frameworks for the electricity, heating, and cooling

sectors, and the transport system. Such new framework conditions and the political

and regulative interventions necessary for their implementation are widely discussed

in the literature. However, assessing their feasibility and effectiveness requires an

in-depth analysis of specific regional and national conditions and mechanisms.

Therefore, societal frameworks, measures, and policy interventions are not explicitly

discussed in this scenario analysis, but they are implicit elements in the definition of

the narratives and assumptions as core step of scenario development (see Chap. [^5]:).

[^3]: Methodology

28

**Modelling Approach**

To develop a global plan, the authors combined various established computer

models:

• Global GHG Model: The non-energy GHG emissions scenarios are calculated

with the following models:

– Generalized Equal Quantile Walk (GQW): This statistical method is used to
complement the CO[^2]: pathways with the non-CO[^2]: regional emissions for the
relevant GHGs and aerosols, based on a statistical analysis of the large num-
ber (~700) of multi-gas emission pathways underlying the recent IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report and the recently published IPCC Special Report on
1.5 °C. The GQW method calculates the median non-CO[^2]: gas emission levels
every 5 years, conditional on the energy-related CO[^2]: emission level percentile
of the ‘source’ pathway. This method is further developed in this project—
building on an earlier ‘Equal Quantile Walk’ method—and is now better able
to capture the emission dynamics of low-mitigation pathways.
– Land-based sequestration design: A Monte Carlo analysis across temperate,
boreal, subtropical, and tropical regions has been performed based on various
literature-based estimates of sequestration rates, sequestration periods, and the
areas available for a number of sequestration options. This approach can be seen
as a quantified literature synthesis of the potential for land-based CO[^2]: sequestra-
tion, which is not reliant on bioenergy with sequestration and storage (BECCS)
– Carbon cycle and climate modelling (MAGICC): This study used the
MAGICC climate model, which also underlies the classification of both the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and the IPCC Special Report on 1.5  °C in
terms of the ability of various scenarios to limit the temperature increase to
below 2.0  °C or 1.5  °C.  MAGICC is constantly evolving, but its core goes
back to the 1980s, and it represents one of the most established reduced-
complexity climate models in the international community.
• Renewable Resource Assessment [R]E-SPACE: This is based on a Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) approach and provides maps of the solar and wind poten-
tials in space-constrained environments. GIS attempts to emulate processes in the real
world, at a single point in time or over an extended period (Goodchild 2005). The
primary purpose of GIS mapping is to ascertain whether renewable energy resources
(primarily solar and wind) are sufficiently available in each region. It also provides an
overview of the existing electricity infrastructures for fossil fuel and renewable sources.
• Transport model (TRAEM): The transport scenario model allows the representa-
tion of long-term transport developments in a consistent and transparent way.
The model disaggregates transport into a set of different modes and calculates
the final energy demand by multiplying the specific transport demand of each
transport mode with the powertrain-specific energy demands, using passenger–
km and tonne–km activity-based bottom-up approaches. The model applied is an
accounting system, without system or ownership cost-optimization.
• Energy system model (EM): The scenario model is a mathematical accounting
system for the energy sector that applies different methodologies. It aims to

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

```
model the development of energy demand and supply according to the energy
potentials, future costs, emissions, specific fuel consumptions, and physical
flows between processes. The data available and the objectives of the analysis
significantly influence the model architecture and approach. It is very important
to differentiate between an energy model and a scenario. An energy model is the
technical basis for a scenario. Scenarios are the results of the energy model,
which have been calculated with different input data and assumptions. The
energy model is used in this study to develop long-term scenarios for the energy
systems across all sectors (power, heat, transport, and industry) without the
application of cost-optimization based on uncertain cost assumptions. However,
an ex-post analysis of costs and investments shows the main economic effects of
the pathways.
```

• Power system model [R]E 24/7: This simulates the electricity system on an
hourly basis and at geographic resolution to assess the requirements for infra-
structure, such as grid connections, between different regions and electricity
storages, depending on the demand profiles and power-generation characteristics
(Teske [^2015]:). High-penetration or renewable-energy-only scenarios will contain
significant proportions of variable solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power
because they are inexpensive. Therefore, a power system model is required to
assess the demand and supply patterns, the efficiency of power generation, and
the resulting infrastructural needs. On the generation side, meteorological data,
typically in 1 h steps, are required and historical solar and wind data are used to
calculate the possible renewable power generation. On the demand side, either
historical demand curves are used, or—if unavailable—demand curves are cal-
culated based on assumptions of consumer behaviour, the electrical equipment
and common electrical appliances.

Figure 3.1 provides an overview of the interactions between the energy- and
GIS-based models. The climate model is not directly connected but provided the
probabilistic temperatures for the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios. The land-use and
non-CO[^2]: emissions modules provide information on additional gases based on the

energy-related CO[^2]: emissions (output of the energy model). Besides the climate and
energy models, the effects on employment and the requirements for selected metal

resources have been calculated (see Sects. 3.6 and 3.7).

**3.2 Global Mapping—Renewable Energy Potential in Space-**
**Constrained Environments: [R]E-SPACE**

The primary purpose of GIS mapping is to ascertain the renewable energy resources
(primarily solar and wind) available in each region. It also provides an overview of
the existing electricity infrastructures for fossil fuel and renewable sources.
In this project, mapping was undertaken with the computer software QGIS. QGIS
is a free, cross-platform, open-source desktop GIS application that supports the
viewing, editing, and analysis of geo-spatial data. It analyses and edits spatial infor-
mation and composes and exports graphical maps, and was used to allocate solar

source data and maps from various sources were used to visualize each country and

its regions and districts. The regions and districts are divided into clusters. The

regions are divided along geographic boundaries, using the IEA regions as a guide.

Some of the larger countries, such as China and India, have been extracted to create

individual scenarios. The clusters are also divided on geographic and political bases.

from Vaisala [^2017]:. For this analysis, wind speed at a height of 80 m was used to

determine the electricity-generation potential. Wind speeds are categorized and

mapped within the range of 5–12 m/s to gain an understanding of the potential gen-

eration across the regions. Speeds under 5 m/s are ignored when plotting optimal

sites. Land-cover types were constrained to bare soil and grasslands. The model

only accounts for the onshore wind-generation potential.

Land-cover data were obtained from the Global Land Cover 2000 project (Global

Land Cover [^2015]:), hosted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.

The classification was based on the FAO Land Cover Classification System.

Similarly, solar resource data were obtained from the Global Solar Atlas (Global

Solar Atlas [^2016]:), owned by the World Bank Group and provided by SolarGis. Data

categorized by direct normal irradiation were mapped to estimate the potential PVs

in the different regions. To avoid conflict with competing uses of land, only the land-

cover types ‘bare soil’ and ‘grasslands’ were included in the analysis.

The area of land available for potential solar and wind power generation was

calculated at the cluster level using the Geometry tool in the QGIS-processing tool-

box. Intersects (overlapping areas between different layers) were created between

the transmission-level layers and the solar/wind utility vector layers to break down

the total land area available into clusters. A correction was put in place manually for

sites that intersected the cluster boundaries and were part of two clusters.

For some maps (India, China, the Middle East, and OECD Pacific) with large

data files, the analysis was performed using raster files for land use and renewable

potentials. The raster tools ‘clipper’ (used to cut a raster file to the size of the clus-

ter) and ‘merge’ (used to extract common areas between two layers) were used. This

input was fed into the calculations for the [R]E 24/7 Model.

```
The regional maps illustrate the different clusters that were identified for sce-
```

nario modelling. The existing infrastructure maps highlight the power plants and

transmission networks in the regions. The wind and solar potential maps indicate

the land available for new power generation given the current land-use patterns.

These maps show utility-scale installations. There are much larger expanses of land

available for small-scale distributed energy generation.

The following types of maps were created for 10 world regions:

Regional breakdown into a maximum of eight clusters:

world regions—broken down into eight sub-regions (clusters). The [R]E 24/7 power

system analysis (see Sect. 3.5) calculates an electricity demand and supply scenario

for each of those eight clusters. The clusters can exchange electricity with each

other (see Sect. 3.8).

For the development of future electricity scenarios, it is important to know whether

the generation capacity for dispatch and the transmission capacity to transport elec-

tricity from utility-scale wind and/or solar power plants to demand centres are

available.

the remaining regions are used for nature conservation, agriculture, settlement, or

other forms of land use that do not allow the installation of wind farms. The darker

the blue area, the better the wind potential.

concentrated solar power plants.

**3.3 Transport Energy Model-TRAEM**

**3.3.1 Transport Model Structure**

The transport scenario model TRAEM (TRAnsport Energy Model) allows the mod-

elling of long-term transport developments for the 10 world regions. It is divided

into several sub-models according to the transport modes, which are discussed

below. All 10 world regions are aggregated in the world model using a passenger–

km (pkm) and tonne–km (tkm) activity-based bottom-up approach. The model cal-

culates the final energy demand by multiplying the specific transport demand of

each transport mode with the powertrain-specific energy demands. This gives the

annual energy demand for electricity, fossil fuels (diesel, petrol), natural gas, bio-

based fuels, synthetically produced fuels (also called ‘synfuels’), and hydrogen for

each of the 10 world regions. The calculation is performed in 5-year steps, from

2015 to 2050.

For all scenarios (5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C), the 2015 energy demand by region

was adjusted to the IEA World Energy Balances 2017 and is therefore identical in

all scenarios. The projected total energy demands for the reference scenario (5.0 °C)

from 2020 until 2040 follow the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017 Current Policies

Scenario (IEA 2017b). The total energy demands by region for the years 2045 and

2050 were extrapolated linearly based on the 2035–2040 change rates. The 2.0 °C

Scenario was adjusted from 2020 onwards to 2050 in line with the carbon budget of
the 2.0 °C pathway and the 1.5 °C pathway.
In the transport model, the CO[^2]: emissions from biofuels are given a GHG emis-
sion factor of zero, because the downstream emissions level out with the upstream
emissions. The CO[^2]: emissions from synthetic fuels are also given a value of zero,

because the CO[^2]: used for producing the fuels upstream level out the downstream
emissions. The upstream emissions from electricity and hydrogen production and

all other fuels are factored into the energy system model described in Section 5 with
which the transport model has a data interface. The model distinguishes between
road, rail, aviation, and maritime passenger and freight transport modes.

Road passenger transport modes include:

– Light duty vehicles (cars): automobiles, vans and sports utility vehicles with
up to eight seats for private transport, which are further distinguished into
small, medium and large cars;
– 2- and 3-wheel vehicles: includes rollers, motorbikes, and rickshaws;
– Busses: urban, suburban, and long-distance buses and minibuses serving pub-
lic and private-company transport services.

Rail passenger:

– Urban metro/light rail vehicles;
– Regional/intercity trains;
– High-speed trains.

Aviation (passenger):

– Small and medium aircrafts for domestic flights;
– Medium and large aircrafts for international flights, distinguishing narrow-
body, wide-body, and regional jets.

Road freight:

– Light-duty trucks (< 3.5 t gross vehicle weight [GVW]);
– Medium-duty trucks (3.5–15 t GVW);
– Heavy-duty trucks (> 15 t GVW).

Rail freight:

– Ordinary freight, intermodal, and low-density high-value freight trains are
distinguished.

Navigation (freight):

– Inland navigation;
– Coastal ships for domestic navigation and maritime shipping are distinguished
in the model.

We assume that energy efficiency improves over time. The changes in the pow-
ertrain shares over time are mainly driven by fleet electrification. Energy intensities

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

per pkm and per tkm are region-dependent, based on the occupancy rates of the

passenger transport modes and the loading factors for freight vehicles. The energy

demands of all transport modes (passenger and freight) are summed to the total

energy demand by region.

Backcasting transport scenarios are modelled iteratively by fitting the drivetrain

shares, transport performance (pkm or tkm), and modal shares until the specific

downstream CO[^2]: budgets of the world regions are met. The emission reductions are
based on a combination of technical, operational, and behavioural measures during

modelling—such as powertrain electrification, the use of biomass-based and syn-
thetically produced fuels, efficiency increases within transport modes, and modal
shifts towards more-efficient modes.
The replacement of internal combustion engines by electric powertrains is priori-
tized in our modelling. However, the rapid electrification of fleets is quantity-
restricted over the immediately subsequent years until the capacities for battery
production, battery recharging, hydrogen production, and refuelling stations have
ramped up ubiquitously. Therefore, a shift towards more energy-efficient and elec-
trified passenger and freight transport modes, such as railways, is required and is
therefore one measure implemented in the model. Such modal shifts are especially
required in the OECD countries, to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining
transport performance at the current levels. Supply constraints on biomass and espe-
cially synfuel production will also limit rapid decarbonisation right from the start,
and motivate modal shifts and general restrictions to overall transport activities by
carbon-intensive transport modes. The 1.5  °C Scenario requires electrification,
modal shifts, and alternative fuel uptake to start earlier than the 2.0 °C Scenario and
particularly the 5.0  °C Scenario, and their more rapid implementation. However,
because electrification will remain quantity-restricted until the 2020s in any case,
widespread modal shifts and changes in mobility behaviour are modelled more
stringently within the 1.5 °C Scenario. The detailed modelling results are discussed
in Chap. [^6]:.

**3.3.2 Transport Data**

We have derived historical and current data on transport activities (pkm, tkm) and

total energy consumption levels according to transport mode from statistical agen-

cies, governmental and intergovernmental organizations, etc., including:

– IEA Mobility Model;
– OECD statistics;
– World Bank Open Data;
– National and supranational statistical bodies;
– UIC IEA Railway Handbook;
– UIC Railway Synopsis;
– Railway operators data;

[^3]: Methodology

38

– HBEFA (Handbuch Emissionsfaktoren);
– EIA Open Data.

However, statistical data are often unavailable or lack consistency with other

derived data (for example, on vehicle stock or occupancy rates in certain world

regions). In these cases, we applied best guesses based on the scientific and grey

literature. Data for energy intensity per transport mode were derived from the

German Aerospace Centre (DLR) vehicle databases and the state-of-the-art

literature.

**3.3.3 Transport Model Output**

Based on the TRAEM model, energy consumption and CO[^2]: emissions can be calcu-
lated for each transport sub-category.

The final energy demand (ED) of the passenger and freight transport modes is
calculated for every world region and all powertrains in 5-year steps from 2015 to
2050 in the following way:

**3.4 Energy System Model (EM)**

The focus of this study is the development of normative, long-term scenarios. The

scenarios are target-oriented. Starting from the identified desirable future in 2050,

they use a backcasting process to deliver potential transformation pathways for the

energy system. Technical bottom-up scenarios are developed to meet the climate

targets in terms of cumulative CO[^2]: emissions and are then compared with a refer-
ence case. The scenarios are based on detailed input data sets that consider defined

targets, renewable and fossil fuel energy potentials, and specific parameters for
power, heat, and fuel generation in the energy systems. The scenarios are repre-
sented in the Energy System model (EM) developed by the DLR, which is imple-
mented in the energy simulation platform Mesap/PlaNet (Seven2one [^2012]:;
Schlenzig [^1998]:). Mesap/PlaNet is an accounting framework that allows the calcula-
tion of detailed and complete energy system balances, from demand to energy sup-
ply, in 5-year steps up to 2050. The model consists of two independent modules:

• a flow calculation module, which balances energy supply and demand annually,
and
• a cost calculation module for the calculation of the corresponding investment,
generation, and fuel costs.

The strength of the model framework is in its flexible and transparent modelling
of different normative paths. The approach requires exogenously defined expansion
rates and market shares. It explicitly renounces economic optimization because of
the uncertainty of long-term cost assumptions. Therefore, scenario development
using this modelling approach is mainly based on background knowledge and
derived narratives, and the experience and knowledge of the scenario developer is
essential to the success of the scenario-building process. The model acts as a frame-
work for integrating a wide variety of aspects of the transformation of energy sys-
tems, and therefore differs fundamentally from optimization models. The
standardized cost calculation for the power sector is used for the ex-post evaluation
of the scenarios. The modelling framework combines a database with a graphical
programming interface. The database allows the management of both the input
parameters and the simulation output for the different scenarios calculated. The
graphical interface allows the definition of the structure of the modelled system and
the quantitative interdependences between the individual structural elements at dif-
ferent structural depths.
The scope of the scenario model allows the increasing electrification processes
in the heating and transport sectors to be considered, such as electric vehicles, elec-
tric boilers, heat pumps, and hydrogen use. Co-generation in different sectors is also
explicitly represented in the model. The EM is implemented in this framework and
Figure 3.6 gives an overview of its structure.
Details of the structure and relevant model equations were also recently described
by Simon et  al. ([^2018]:). The model calculates the energy flows of a system on an

[^3]: Methodology

40

annual basis. These flows connect a set of technologies in each sector and for all
relevant energy carriers, using linear equations. The equation system is solved
sequentially and the model thus balances demand and supply. This approach is
applied over the scenario period in 5-year steps until 2050. Ultimately, the overall
final energy is calculated as described in the following equations:

• demand for energy services, such as useful heat;
• different transport modes based on the Transport Model (see Sect. 3.4).

The model consists of a broad technology database across the heat, fuel, and
power sectors, including sector coupling via combined heat and power (CHP),
power-to-heat, and power-to-fuels technologies, and electric mobility.
For both heat and electricity production, the model distinguishes between differ-

ent technologies, characterized by their primary energy sources, efficiency, and

costs. Examples include biomass or gas burners, heat pumps, solar thermal and

geothermal technologies, and several power-generation technologies, such as PV,

onshore and offshore wind, biomass, gas, coal, nuclear, and CHP. In the transport

sector, the model is directly linked to the results of the transport model (Sect. 3.3).

For each technology, the market share with respect to total heat or electricity pro-

duction is specified according to a range of assumptions, including targets, potential

costs, and societal, structural, and economic barriers. The model eventually calcu-

lates the annual energy flows for a set of energy carriers.

The main inputs of the Energy System Model are:

• IEA World Energy Balances 2017 (IEA 2016a) for the calibration of the model

for each world region in the years 2005–2015;

• IEA World Energy Outlook 2016/2017 (IEA 2016b, 2017a) for the parameteriza-

tion of the model for the reference case (5.0 °C Scenario);

• various studies and statistics used for the assumption of further specific values,

```
such as the power-to-heat ratios of co-generation plants, coefficients of perfor-
mance of heat pumps, and the efficiency of hydrogen electrolysers and synthetic
fuel production plants;
```

• narratives and assumptions regarding the further development of demand and

```
supply technologies in line with the climate targets and by taking into account
RES potentials and costs, stable market developments, and the constraints
imposed by production capacities and regional implementation. These assump-
tions and narratives are described in detail in Chap. 5, Sect. 4.
```

The main outputs of the model are:

• the final and primary energy demands, broken down by fuel, technology, and

```
energy sectors, as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA)—industry,
power generation, transport, and other (buildings, forestry, and fisheries);
```

• the results broken down by the three main types of energy demand—electricity,

```
heating, and mobility (transport); specifically, the energy required, technology
deployment, and financial investment for each of these energy demand types;
```

• total energy budget, which is the total cost of energy for the whole power

system;

• energy-related CO[^2]: emissions over the projected period.

**3.5 [R]E 24/7 (UTS-ISF)**

The long-term scenarios calculated with the EM for 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050

(see Sect. 3.4) are used as the input data for the dispatch modelling described in this

section. The [R]E 24/7 model transforms a long-term scenario for a specific year

into hourly load and generation curves. The annual electricity demand is trans-

formed into an hourly load curve (see Sect. 3.2) and the annual power generation is

transformed into a generation time series for variable power generation from

regional solar and wind data and dispatchable power-generation data via inter-

changeable dispatch orders (see Sect. 3.7). The [R]E24/7 model is an accounting

framework used to calculate the complete power system balance at 1 h resolution,

and consists of two modules:

1. a flow calculation module, which balances the energy supply and demand; and
2. a cost calculation module, which calculates the corresponding generation and

fuel costs.

The [R]E 24/7 model examines the influence of the dispatch order of power-

generation technologies, the storage technologies, and the interconnection of up to

eight regions. It calculates the impact of these variables on the overall system costs.

[R]E 24/7 also calculates load curves for the residential, industry, and transport sec-

tors based on the sector-specific energy intensity factors and applications that are in

use. The factors and applications used depend on the GDP and population (see Sect.

3.2).

**3.5.1 [R]E 24/7—Model Structure**

Teske ([^2015]:) has developed a three-level grid model called ‘[R]E 24/7’ as a grid

analysis tool that differentiates between four voltage levels. For this analysis, the

model has been simplified to eight interconnected clusters to reduce the data volume

and the calculation time. High resolution, with multiple voltage levels, is impracti-

cal for a global energy scenario, because the required input data would not be avail-

able for all regions and—if the data were available—the calculation time would be

extremely long. Therefore, the simplified [R]E 24/7 model uses eight clusters that

can exchange electricity on an hourly basis with a user-defined interconnection

capacity (see Sect. 3.8). Different voltage levels are not calculated. Figure 3.7 pro-

vides an overview of the different modules of the [R]E 24/7 model. In the first step,

a database provides the main input data for the base year, including socio-economic

parameters, the currently available power generation, and the energy infrastructure.

The data are partly with the GIS tool (see Sect. 3.2) and partly from other informa-

tion resources, such as publicly available databases of populations (UN PD DB

[^2018]:), GDP (CIA [^2018]:; ST 7-[^2018]:), and energy efficiency indicators (WEC [^2018]:),

[^3]: Methodology

44

and statistical data on renewable power generation from IRENA (REN21-GSR

[^2018]:) and the World Resources Institute (WRI [^2018]:).

**3.5.2 Development and Calculation of Load Curves**

Energy demand projections and the calculation of load curves are important factors

in calculating supply security and the dispatch and storage capacities required, espe-

cially for energy supply concepts with high proportions of variable renewable power

generation. The [R]E 24/7 model calculates the development of the future power

demand and the resulting possible load curves, because:

(a) Actual demand curves are not available for all countries and/or regions and are
sometimes classified information.

(b) Future load curves with high penetration of storage, electric heating systems

and electric mobility will have a very different shape than current load curves.
(c) For developing countries with low access to energy rates or little access to suf-
ficient data, the curves must be calculated based on a set of assumptions because
actual curves are neither available nor representative of future load curves.

The model generates load curves and the resulting annual power demands for

• households;
• industry and business; and
• transport (public and individual electric mobility).

Although each sector has its specific consumer groups and applications, the same

set of parameters is used to calculate load curves:

• electrical applications in use;
• demand pattern (24 h);
• efficiency progress (base year 2015) for 2020 until 2050, and individual effi-

ciency input for each year.

The calculations involve detailed bottom-up projections of the increased use of

electricity for heating in buildings, for industrial process heat, for electric mobility,

and for the production of synthetic fuels and hydrogen. They also include increased

access to energy in developing countries based on the applications used, the demand

patterns, and the household types. This allows detailed demand projections to be

made.

Infrastructure needs, such as power grids combined with storage facilities,

require in-depth knowledge of local loads and generation capacities. In this project,

the annual electricity demand for each of the 10 world regions was calculated with

the long-term EM. The [R]E 24/7 model breaks each region into up to eight sub-

regions (or clusters) to calculate hourly load and generation curves.

**3.5.3 Load Curve Calculation for Households**

The model differentiates nine household groups, with various degrees of electrifica-

tion and equipment:

• Rural—phase 1: Minimal electrification stage
• Rural—phase 2: White goods are introduced and increase the overall demand
• Rural—phase 3: Fully equipped western-standard household with electrical

cooking and air conditioning and electric vehicle(s)

• Urban single: Single-person household with minimal equipment
• Urban shared flat: 3–5 persons share one apartment; fully equipped western

household, but without electric vehicles

• Urban—Family 1: 2 adults and 2–3 children; middle income, middle western

standard

• Urban—Family 2: 2 adults and > 3 children and/or higher income, full western

standard

• Suburbia 1: average family, middle income, full equipment, high transport

demand due to extensive commuting

• Suburbia 2: High-income household, fully equipped, extremely high transport

demand due to high-end vehicles and extensive commuting

The following electrical equipment and applications can be selected:

• Lighting: 4 different light bulb types (LED, three efficiency classes of CFLs),
• Cooking: 10 different cooking stoves (2+4 burners, electricity, gas, firewood)
• Entertainment: 3 different efficiency levels of computers, TV, and radio types
• White goods: 2 different efficiency levels each for washing machine, dryer,

fridge, freezer

• Climatization: 2 different efficiency levels each for fan, air-conditioning
• Water heating: A selection of direct electric, heat-pump, and solar heating

systems

**3.5.4 Load Curve Calculation for Business and Industry**

The industrial sector is clustered into eight groups based on widely used statistical

categories:

• Agriculture
• Manufacturing
• Mining
• Iron and steel
• Cement industry
• Construction industry
• Chemical industry
• Service and trade

Each sector has a definite energy intensity in energy per dollar GDP (MJ/$GDP),
which is been converted to electrical units (kW/$GDP) based on an estimated fuel
efficiency factor, electricity shares, and operational hours per year. The calculated
electricity intensity per dollar GDP conversion can only show the required con-
nected load and the specific consumption of an industrial sector to a first approxima-
tion because there is a variety of uncertainty factors, such as:

(a) significant regional differences;
(b) significant demand differences within one industry sector, such as _manufactur-_
_ing_ or _chemical industry_;
(c) lack of standardized data on industry energy demands, especially for the elec-
tricity sector.

Despite the high degree of uncertainty, we decided to apply this methodology
because after an initial calibration, the current statistically recorded industrial elec-
tricity consumption in some well-documented countries (e.g., USA) and regions
(e.g., Europe) can be recalculated with a tolerance of ± 10%. However, this method-
ology requires further research.

**3.5.5 Load Distribution by Cluster**

The spatial concept of the [R]E 24/7 is shown in Fig. 3.8. The model calculates the

load distribution for one region, which can be broken down further to a maximum

of eight sub-regions (or ‘clusters’). Therefore, the 10 world regions modelled in this

analysis are calculated separately. OECD North America, for example, includes

Canada, USA, and Mexico. These three countries can be subdivided into up to eight

clusters. A cluster can be a country (e.g., Mexico), a province/state of a country

(e.g., Alaska), or a selection of several provinces/states (e.g., West Canada = British

Columbia, Alberta, Yukon Territory, and North-West Territories). A cluster is

defined to capture the existing interconnected power supply areas of a region, a

country, or across several provinces. In Europe, for example, one cluster is the

Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), a region within Europe that has only very

limited interconnection with the central European grid system (UCT-E). However,

data availability and the model limitations (maximum of eight clusters) force sim-

plifications, and countries or state/provinces must be bundled together in one cluster

even though they may have significant differences. Therefore, further research is

required to obtain more detailed results for selected countries or provinces.

```
The distribution of the regional load, calculated in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4, is con-
```

nected to the projected GDP, population, and power plant capacities for each cluster.

The cluster-specific data for the base year (2015) are taken from the model’s data-

base interface to calculate the demand and supply for the base year. When data are

not available for each sub-region, the input data from the entire region will be bro-

ken down (in percentages) by cluster, according to the population—as a result of the

GIS analysis. For the global analysis, the spatial distribution of the population,

GDP, and power plant capacities remain unchanged over the modelled years (2020–

2050) for all 10 regions and their respective sub-regions. In the next step, the result-

ing population and GDP values for each cluster are multiplied by the normalized

load curves calculated as described in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4. Each cluster has an hourly

load curve over one entire year (8760  h). Thus, one region (e.g., OCED North

America) has eight different load curves.

**3.5.6 The [R]E 24/7 Dispatch Module**

Although the dispatch module for the [R]E 24/7 energy access model has been

developed specifically for this study, integral parts have been taken from a model

developed to analyse the generation and storage needs for a micro grid on Kangaroo

Island (Dunstan and Fattal [^2016]:), the Australian Storage Requirements (Rutovitz

and James [^2017]:), and a 100% Renewable Energy Analysis for Tanzania (Teske and

Morris [^2017]:). The key objective of this modelling is to calculate the theoretical

generation and storage requirements for energy adequacy in each cluster and for the

whole survey region (Tables 3.2 and 3.3).

```
Figure 3.9 provides an overview of the dispatch calculation process for one clus-
```

ter. The key inputs include the generation capacities by type, the demand projec-

tions and load curves for each cluster, the interconnection with other clusters, and

the meteorological data from which to calculate the solar and wind power genera-

tion at hourly resolution. The calculation of one region with eight sub-regions will
require eight calculation intervals. Table 3.4 shows the four different supply tech-
nology groups: variable renewables, dispatch power plants, storage technologies,
and interconnections. The model allows the order in which the technology groups
will be utilized to be changed to satisfy the demand. Storage and interconnection
cannot be selected as the first supply technology. Within each technology group, the
dispatch order can be changed. Tables 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 provide an overview of all
the available technologies and examples of different dispatch scenarios. While CSP
plants with storage are dispatchable to some extent—depending on the storage size
and the available solar radiation—they are part of the variable renewable group in
the [R]E 24/7 model. Although the model allows the dispatch order to change, the
100% renewable energy analysis always follows the same dispatch logic. The model
identifies excess renewable production, which is defined as potential wind and solar
PV generation greater than the actual hourly demand in MW during a specific hour.
To avoid curtailment, the surplus renewable electricity should be stored with some
form of electric storage technology or exported to a different cluster. Within the
model, the excess renewable production accumulates through the dispatch order. If
storage is present, it will charge the storage within the limits of the input capacity.
If no storage is present, this potential excess renewable production is reported as
‘potential curtailment’ (pre-storage).

**Limitations:** It is important to note that the calculation of possible interconnection
capacities for transmission grids between sub-regions does not replace technical
grid simulation. Grid services, such as inductive power supply, frequency control,
and stability, should be analysed, although this is beyond the scope of this analysis.
The results of [R]E 24/7 provide a first rough estimate of whether the increased use
of storage or increased interconnection capacities or a mix of both will reduce sys-
tems costs.

**3.5.7 Meteorological Data**

Variable power-generation technologies are dependent on the local solar radiation
and wind regimes. Therefore, all installed capacities of this technology group are
connected to cluster-specific time series. The data were derived from the database
_Renewable Ninja_ (RE-N DB [^2018]:), which allows the simulation of the hourly
power output from wind and solar power plants at specific geographic positions
throughout the world. Weather data, such as temperature, precipitation, and snow-
fall, for the year 2014 are also available.

To utilize climatization technologies for buildings (air-conditioning, electric

heating), the demand curves for households and services are connected to the

cluster-specific temperature time series. The demand for lighting is connected to the

solar time series to accommodate the variability in lighting demand across the year,

especially in northern and southern regions, which have significantly longer day-

light periods in summer and very short daylight periods in winter.

**3.5.7.1 Solar and Wind Time Series**

For every region included in the model, hourly output traces are utilized for onshore

wind, offshore wind, utility solar, CSP, and roof-top solar energies. Given the num-

ber of clusters and the geographic extent of the study, and the uncertainty associated

with the prediction of the spatial distribution of future generation systems, an repre-

sentative site was selected for each of the five generation types. For utility solar and

CSP, the indicative sites were situated in areas of high solar output, close to the

transmission network or regional centre or city, and in areas without competing land

uses (as described in the mapping methodology). A roof-top solar indicative site

was chosen in the demographic centre of the region, usually the capital city.

The onshore wind indicative site selected for each region was situated in an area

of non-competing land use with the highest average wind speed and close to the

transmission network or regional centre or city. The offshore wind indicative site

was an area within 100 km of the shore with the highest average wind speed, and

close to the transmission network or regional centre or city. In some cases, no

acceptable wind area within a region was available, in which case the wind potential

was set to zero.

Once the indicative sites were chosen, the hourly output values for typical solar

arrays and wind farms were selected using the database of Stefan Pfenninger at

ETH Zurich and Iain Stafell (Renewables.ninja; see above). The model methodol-

ogy used by the Renewables.ninja database is described by Pfenninger and Staffell

(2016a, b), and is based on weather data from global reanalysis models and satellite

observations (Rienecker and Suarez [^2011]:; Müller and Pfeifroth, [^2015]:; SARAH

[^2018]:). It was assumed that the utility solar sites were optimized, and as such, a tilt

angle was selected within a couple of degrees of the latitude of the indicative site.

For roof-top solar, this was left at the default 35° because it is likely that the panels

matched the roof tilt.

The wind outputs for both onshore and offshore wind were calculated at an 80 m
hub height because this reflects the wind data sets used in the mapping exercise.
Although onshore wind and offshore wind are likely be higher than this, 80 m was
considered a reasonable approximation and made our model consistent with the
mapping-based predictions. A turbine model of Vestas V90 2000 was used.

**Limitations:** The solar and wind resources can differ within one cluster. In some

cases, there are even different climate zones within one large cluster, e.g., in

Australia and Russia. Therefore, the potential generation output can vary within a

cluster and across the model period (2020–2050). Furthermore, some clusters

extend significantly across several time zones, such as Russia. The model can only

take into account the time variations in sunrise and sunset between different clus-

ters, but not within a single cluster. The effect of time differences within clusters

with a large east–west spread requires high-resolution modelling, which is possible

with the [R]E 24/7 model but beyond the scope of this research project.

**3.5.8 Interconnection Capacities**

The interconnection capacities are set as a function of the total generation capacity
within a cluster and a manually set percentage. Defining the relevant percentage of
a country’s overall (peak) capacity and/or total generation capacity is based on
European energy policy. The European Union (EU) proposed in 2002 that all EU
member states must establish a transmission capacity of at least 10% of the peak
demand (in megawatts) by 2005 (EMP-BARCELONA [^2002]:). The EU developed
this regulation further, improved the calculation method, and increased the target to
15% (EU-EG [^2017]:), whereas the [R]E 24/7 model implements a simplified approach
by taking a percentage of the overall installed capacity. Clusters that are not con-
nected at all to the real energy market (e.g., South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New
Zealand in the OECD Pacific region) are assigned 0% interconnection capacity.
Responsibly well-connected clusters (such as the south-western USA) are set to
15%, and highly interconnected countries (such as Denmark) are assigned up to
40%.
Several simplifications have been made to the [R]E 24/7 model for ease of com-
putation and to accommodate the paucity of data and uncertainty about the future
when designing the interconnector algorithms:

– Interconnections between the project-defined regions are the only ones consid-
ered, so all intra-regional interconnections or line constraints are excluded (‘_cop-_
_per plate_’);
– Optimal load flow is neglected because policy and price signals are considered to
be the factors dominating the international and inter-regional load flow;
– Non-adjacent inter-regional interconnections are neglected for computational
reasons, e.g., one region cannot buy power from a region with which it does not
share a border.

[^3]: Methodology

54

The algorithm devised for the function of the interconnectors is based on three

key pieces of information for each region in a cluster:

– Excess generation capacity;
– Unmet load;
– Interconnection capacity with each adjacent region, both in and out.

The excess generation capacity and unmet load were calculated by running the

model without the interconnectors to determine the excess or shortfall in generation

when the load within the region is met. These excesses and shortfalls were calcu-

lated at the point in the dispatch cascade at which the interconnectors provide or

consume power, for example, after the variable renewables and dispatchable gen-

erators and before the storage elements.

The interconnection capacity between adjacent regions was defined based on a

percentage of the maximum regional load. The capacity was defined in a matrix,

both to and from every region to every other region. For non-adjacent regions, the

capacities were set to zero. A priority order for each region to every other region was

given, so that if the region had an unmet load, it would be served sequentially with

the excess generation of the loads in their defined order.

For every hour and for every region in each cluster, the possible interconnection

inflow or outflow for load balancing was calculated. Each region was considered in

turn, and the algorithm attempted to meet the unmet load with excess generation by

adjacent regions, keeping track of the residual excess load and interconnector

capacities. Each region’s internal load was met first, before its generation resources

were considered for other interconnected regions.

Once the total inflow and outflow of the interconnectors were calculated, the

hourly values were fed into the model once more at the position in the cascade to

which they were assigned, and the model was run again to give the total system

behaviour. For regions sending generation capacity to other regions, the intercon-

nector element behaved as an increase in load, whereas for regions accepting power

from neighbouring regions, the interconnector element behaved as an additional

generator, from the model’s perspective.

**3.6 Employment Modelling (UTS-ISF)**

Two of the key dimensions influencing the social and economic impacts of the tran-

sition from fossil-fuel to clean energy are the quantity and type of jobs that are lost

and created. Currently, there are limited data on the volumes of jobs that will be lost

and created within particular occupations and locations during the transition to

clean energy. National statistical agencies classify and collect data on occupations

within the fossil fuel sectors but not within the renewable energy sectors (ABS

[^2017]:). ISF has developed a model to estimate the volume of renewable energy jobs

under different 100% global renewable energy scenarios (Rutovitz and Dominish

[^2015]:), and an increasing body of research is estimating the jobs created by

```

```

renewable energy. The following section provides an overview of the basic method-

ology. Based on this, UTS/ISF has developed this methodology further, as presented

in Sect. 3.2.

**3.6.1 Quantitative Employment Calculation**

In 2015, the Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology

Sydney (UTS) developed a quantitative employment model that calculates employ-

ment development in the electricity, heating, and fuel production sectors for the

analysis of future energy pathways (Rutovitz and Dominish [^2015]:). Figure 3.10 pro-

vides a simplified overview of how the calculations are performed, based on

Rutovitz (2015b). The main inputs for the quantitative employment calculations

are:

```
for each calculated scenario, e.g., the 5.0 °C (Sect. 5.1.1) and 2.0 °C Scenarios
```

(Sect. 5.1.2),

• the electrical and heating capacity that will be installed each year for each

technology;

• the primary energy demand for coal, gas, and biomass fuels in the electricity and

heating sectors;

• the amount of electricity generated per year from nuclear power, oil, and diesel.

for each technology:

• ‘employment factors’, or the number of jobs per unit of capacity, separated into

```
manufacturing, construction, operation, and maintenance, and per unit of pri-
mary energy for fuel supply;
```

• for the 2020, 2030, and 2050 calculations, a ‘decline factor’ for each technology,

```
which reduces the employment factors by a certain percentage per year. This
reflects the fact that employment per unit decreases as technology efficiencies
improve.
```

for each region:

• the percentage of local manufacturing and domestic fuel production in each

```
region, to calculate the proportions of jobs in manufacturing and fuel production
that occur in the region;
```

• the percentage of world trade in coal and gas fuels, and traded renewable compo-

nents that originates in each region.

A ‘regional job multiplier’, which indicates how labour-intensive the economic

activity is in that region compared with the OECD, is used to adjust the OECD

employment factors when local data are not available. The figures for the increase

in electrical capacity and energy use from each scenario are multiplied by the

employment factors for each of the technologies, and then adjusted for regional

[^3]: Methodology

56

labour intensity and the proportion of fuel or manufacturing that occurs locally. The

calculation is summarized in Fig. 3.10.

A range of data sources were used for the model inputs, including the International

Energy Agency, US Energy Information Administration, BP Statistical Review of

World Energy, US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, International Labour

Organization, World Bank, industry associations, national statistics, company

reports, academic literature, and the ISF’s own research.

These calculations only take into account direct employment; for example, the

construction team required to build a new wind farm. They do not include indirect

employment; for example, the extra services provided in a town to accommodate

the construction team. The calculations do not include jobs in energy efficiency

because this is beyond the scope of this project. The large number of assumptions

required to make these calculations means that employment numbers are only esti-

mates, especially for regions where few data exist. However, within the limits of

data availability, the figures presented are representative of employment levels

under the 5.0 °C and 2.0 °C Scenarios.

**3.6.2 Occupational Employment Modelling**

The quantitative employment model documented in Sect. 3.6.1 were further devel-

oped to analyse the qualitative occupational composition of employment in the fos-

sil fuel and renewable energy industries. UTS-ISF has developed a framework for

modelling disaggregated occupational change, and this framework is described in

this section.

Quantitative employment studies at the level of technology and project phases

(manufacturing, construction, and O&M) are useful when providing estimates of

aggregate job creation. However, more disaggregated, granular data on the locations

and types of occupations are required to plan a just transition to renewable energy.

For example, it is necessary to know how many electricians are currently employed

in fossil fuel industries and how many will be employed in the renewable energy

sectors. Although our forecasts will almost inevitably be wrong, key trends can be

established. For example, we can direct our focus to areas of the workforce in which

an increase in the supply of labour will probably be required, and to areas where the

effects of dislocation will be greatest.

Using a variety of data sources, ISF has developed a framework for classifying

and measuring job changes at different levels of occupational disaggregation, to

provide a richer picture of the composition of this employment change. The meth-

odology and key figures are detailed below.

Three primary studies that classify and measure the occupational compositions

of renewable energy industries have been conducted by the International Renewable

Energy Agency (IRENA). Using surveys of the participants in around 45 industries

across a range of developed and developing nations, IRENA has estimated the per-

centages of person-days for the various occupations across the solar PV and onshore

and offshore wind farm supply chains (IRENA [^2017]:). Figure 3.11 is an example (in

this case, for solar PV manufacturing).

IRENA’s studies are the most detailed estimates available of the occupational

compositions of the solar PV and onshore wind sectors. ISF has extended the

application of IRENA’s work. Chapter [^10]: provides more details about the methodol-

ogy and the specific factors used in this analysis.

**3.7 Material and Metal Resources Analysis (UTS-ISF)**

**3.7.1 Methodology—Material and Metal Resources Analysis**

The future demands for metals have been modelled to better understand the resource

requirements of the shift to renewable energy and transport systems. The future

demands for metals have been modelled for the projection of 100% renewable

energy and the full electrification of the transport system by 2050, as described in in

Chap. [^6]:.

[^3]: Methodology

The predicted demand for the metals required to produce clean energy each year
is estimated based on the increase in capacity plus an additional amount required to
replace the capacity or vehicles that reach the ends of their lives in each year (based
on a lifetime distribution curve for the average lifetime). From this, the GW of
capacity or number of vehicles introduced in each year is estimated (also accounting
for the replacement stock for end-of-life technologies).
When assuming that the introduced amount of specific technologies in year _t_ is _lt_ ,
the accumulated stock amount in year _t_ (generation capacity or in-use stock) is _St_, and

the discarded amount in year _t_ is _Ot_ , can be expressed by:

```
SStt=+−1 IOtt− (3.1)
```

Where _Ot_ depends on the number of use years of each product. This use year
varies from product to product, and even within the same product group introduced
into a society in the same year. The discarded year is not constant and has a lifetime
distribution. Therefore, if the number of use years of the product is assumed as _a_,
lifetime distribution can be defined as _g(a)_. Hence, is given by following:

In this book, the Weibull distribution is used to consider the life characteristics of
the products described above, with the key assumptions shown in Table 3.8.
Based on the annual introduced amount of clean energy technologies given by
equation (3.3), the metal demand for technology _p_ in year _t_ is estimated as:

```
Demandpt,,=⋅IMpt etal intensitypt, (3.4)
```

Where _Metal intensity p,t_ is the amount of required metal in technology _p_ in year
_t_. Because this value can change over time with technological developments, we
assume that the various scenarios incorporating the material efficiency
improvement.
The demand estimated with equation (3.4) indicates the total metal requirements
for the introduction of clean energy technologies. This demand arises from primary
production (mined from natural deposits) and secondary production (recovered
from end-of-life products). Secondary production could play an important role in
the future by increasing metal availability and reducing the environmental impact.
Therefore, we evaluated the effects of recycling by estimating the potential reduction
in primary production entailed. When the recycling of end-of-life products is con-
sidered, primary production is given by equation (3.5).

```
Primaryproductionpt,,=−Demandpt DiscardRpt, ⋅ ecyclingratep (3.5)
```

Where _Discardp,t_ is end-of-life technology in year , and is estimated from the
Weibull distribution, and the _Recycling ratep_ indicates the proportion of metals
recovered from end-of-life technology. Since this value can be increased by techno-
logical improvements, the metal price, and the amount of end-of-life product avail-
able, we assumed both the current recycling rate and an improved recycling rate.
This recycling rate is based on the rate of recycling of the metal within the tech-
nology (e.g., silver discarded from solar panels can be recycled into new solar pan-
els), rather than as an average across the use of the metal, as has been done in
previous studies. This has been chosen as the most appropriate recycling rate to use
because we assume that by using recycling rates specific to the technology, it is
more likely to offset demand for new materials for that technology.

Ultimately, the mineral requirements estimated with equations (3.4) and (3.5)
under the various assumptions were compared with metal reserves and annual pro-
duction (in 2017). A ‘reserve’ is regarded as the amount economically extractable
with the current technologies and at the current metal price, and can change signifi-
cantly over time. However, comparing reserves with estimated future requirements
can provide insight into how the introduction of clean energy technologies will
affect the physical availability of metals in the future. We also compared current
production with the estimated future requirements to estimate the likelihood of a
rapid increase in requirements. The key results are presented in Chap. [^11]:.

**3.8.1 Deriving Non-CO**[^2]: **GHG Pathways**

This section provides an overview of the methodology that has been used to com-
plement the energy-related CO[^2]: emission pathways for non-energy-related CO2
emissions, other GHG emissions, and aerosols.
The energy-related CO[^2]: emissions were derived using energy-system modelling
frameworks, but two different approaches have been used to derive the land-use CO2
emissions and other GHG emissions. First, we will describe the approach that was
used to determine other GHG emissions. This approach can be summarized as a
statistical analysis of currently published scenarios. To derive non-CO[^2]: pathways

that are consistent with the relevant emission mitigation levels, the non-CO[^2]: emis-

sions were regressed against the fossil fuel and industrial CO[^2]: emissions. These
regression characteristics were then used to derive the non-CO[^2]: emissions. This
method has been newly developed in the context of this study and can be regarded
as a further development of the Equal Quantile Walk method introduced by
Meinshausen et al. ([^2006]:).
One challenge in applying the collective knowledge that is enshrined in multi-
gas-emission scenarios in the literature is that regional and sectoral definitions differ
slightly between the various modelling groups. Because most IPCC scenarios work
are based on the emission categories used by the IAM community, their emission
categories and regions have been adopted in this analysis of non-CO[^2]: emission path-
ways. The steps in the analysis are described in the following sub-sections.

**3.8.1.1 Regional Definitions**

First, the regional energy-related CO[^2]: emissions developed in the previous sections
must be transformed to match the five Renewable Communities Program (RCP)
regions used by the IAM community, into the regions OECD90 (OECD countries,

membership status as of 1990), ASIA (Asian countries), REF (economies in transi-
tion), LAM (Latin America), and MAF (Middle East and Africa). Table 3.9 (above)
indicates the overlap and differences between the RCP regions with the other
regions described in this report. As an indicator of how different the regional defini-
tions are, we used the fossil fuel and industrial emissions for the year 2015 accord-
ing to the 2017 update of the PRIMAP database (Gütschow et al. [^2016]:).
Table 3.9 provides an overview to the regional definitions used in this study. The
top row indicates the regions for the CO[^2]: fossil and industrial emissions, and the
various rows refer to the five regions used in IAMs. To derive the non-CO[^2]: emis-
sions, we used the IAM’s five RCP regions. The numbers indicate the fossil fuel and
industrial emissions in the year 2015 in MtCO[^2]:, aggregated from country-level data.
The colour shading of the cells indicates where most of the 2015 emissions occurred.
Table 3.9 Regional definitions according to the Integrated Assessment Modelling
community (so-called ‘RCP5’ regions) compared with the other regions used in this
study The overlap and differences between the two sets of regional definitions are
shown with the 2015 fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emissions. For example, the first row
indicates that the largest sub-region in the RCP5_Asia group is China, with 8,826
MtCO[^2]: of emissions.
The transfer of the energy-related CO[^2]: emission results to fit the IAM’s regional
categorization (which is consistent with IEA WEO reports) was performed by first
disaggregating all the results to country-level data. A simple proportional scale was
applied to the 2015 energy-related country-level CO[^2]: emissions from the PRIMAP
database. The disaggregated country-level data were then re-aggregated at the RCP5

regional level.

**3.8.1.2 Harmonization: Emission Category Adjustments**

Before proceeding with the application of CO[^2]: versus non-CO[^2]: statistical relation-
ships, a harmonization step is necessary. Various IAM use slightly different catego-

ries, emission factors, and activity data to estimate emissions. This can result in

some spread in the current emission estimates for the same regions and categories.
To address this issue, the standard practice in the IAM community is to work with
harmonized emissions scenarios, meaning that the original emissions scenarios
have either been scaled or shifted towards a common reference point. A recent his-
torical emission level is normally chosen as this reference point. Here, we chose the
2015 emissions across the five RCP regions.
Harmonization was performed in two steps. First, emissions were added that
were related to the CO[^2]: fossil and industrial emission categories (such as waste-
related emissions) and that were outside the scope of emissions in the energy-related

CO[^2]: emission chapters. The scenarios from which these ‘other’ energy-related CO2
emissions were taken were: the SSP2_Ref_SPA0_V25_upscaled_MESSAGE_

GLOBIOM (for the 5.0 °C reference scenario); SSP1_26_SPA1_V25_IMAGE (for
the 2.0  °C Scenario), and SSP1_19_SPA1_V25_IMAGE scenario (for the 1.5°C
Scenario). In the second harmonization step, the overall sum of the complemented
2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenario CO[^2]: emissions were compared with the overall fossil and
industrial sum of CO[^2]: emissions in the year 2015, which were used for scenario
harmonization under the CMIP6 ScenarioMIP process (Meinshausen et al., in prep-
aration). This comparison revealed that there were still differences between the
complemented energy scenarios (see Chapter [^8]:) and the harmonization emission
levels for the various regions. These differences could again have resulted from dif-
ferent emission factors or activity assumptions, or they could simply reflect genuine
uncertainty in the overall global and regional anthropogenic emissions. Consistent
with the processing steps used in the CMIP6 process, we up- and down-scaled the
raw and regionally disaggregated energy scenario emissions towards the harmoni-
zation emission levels. Figure 3.12 shows the differences between the raw emission
scenario data, the data re-aggregated into the RCP regions, and the CMIP6 emission
harmonization fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emission levels for 2015 (in GtC). The dif-
ferences were bridged by applying a time-constant scaling factor.

**3.8.1.3 A New Quantile Regression Method for Non-CO**[^2]: **Gases**

The completed fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emission time series can now be compared
with the set of scenarios in the literature. In this study, we used 811 scenarios from
CMIP6 databases or the databases underlying the IPCC SR1.5 report. These
literature-reported studies are either reference scenarios or mitigation scenarios
with a specific forcing target or climate target. Some of the scenarios aim for 1.5 °C
levels of change, others for 450 ppm CO[^2]:-equivalence concentrations, and yet oth-
ers assume fragmented worlds, with regional rivalries and no consistent policy
approach. In summary, the input assumptions of all these literature-reported sce-
narios vary widely, yet all have some formal energy-system modelling framework
behind them that provides first-level assurance that the envisaged CO[^2]:, methane,
nitrous oxide, and other gas emission levels are not set below the limits considered
technologically feasible under a certain set of boundary conditions, such as the
requirement to continuing feeding the human population. The technological and
economic feasibilities of emission pathways are fluid concepts, subject to change in
response to technological advances and changes in policy settings.
This study and the approach it uses are not dependent on absolute levels of miti-
gation costs or precise definitions of technological feasibility. Instead, the method
used assumes that that non-CO2 gases are reduced with a similar effort as that
required to reduce CO[^2]: emissions. Therefore, using the emission characteristics
from a large set of scenarios reported in the literature, we assume similar levels of
technological feasibility, economic mitigation costs, and implementation opportuni-
ties will be required to reduce emissions of CO[^2]: and various other gases.
More specifically, we derived the non-CO[^2]: emissions in a particular year by
ranking all the scenarios against the indicator of fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emissions
in that year (see Fig. 3.11 below). By comparing them to the ‘crowd’ of other
literature-reported scenarios, the LDF pathways could also be ranked. Specifically,
the LDF reference scenario turned out to be around the 75th percentile of the
distribution of the fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emissions across all 811 scenarios con-
sidered. By contrast, the lower 1.5 °C Scenario and 2.0 °C Scenario were not at the
absolute lower boundary of the 811 scenario distribution, but were close to it. The
1.5 °C Scenario ranked between the zero and first percentile—that is, among the 1%
most stringent scenarios in the literature for the years 2025–2045. In the period until
2050, the 2.0 °C Scenario was situated between the 5th and 10th percentiles of the
scenario distribution (see Fig. 3.13).
Figure 3.13 shows the 1.5  °C and 2.0  °C Scenarios, their absolute fossil and
industry CO[^2]: emissions until 2050 (upper panel), and their respective locations in
the set of 811 literature-reported scenarios considered (lower panel). The post-2050
scenario extensions were extrapolated differently for fossil and industrial CO[^2]: and
the non-CO[^2]: gases. To derive the non-CO[^2]: gases, the 2050 percentile location was
assumed constant for the remainder of the twenty-first century. For the fossil and

industrial CO[^2]: emissions in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, which do not assume

BECCS to achieve net negative emission levels, a continuation of the constant zero
emission level was assumed (straight constant emission level in the upper panel cor-
responding to the increasing percentile level of the red–blue dashed line in the lower
panel).

**3.8.1.4 ‘Pseudo’ Fossil and Industrial CO**[^2]: **Extensions Beyond 2050**

By the end of the century, almost 40% of all of 811 scenarios will feature net nega-
tive fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emissions, largely because there is some level of bio-
mass and CCS deployment. Given that the energy scenarios developed for this study
do not assume, by design, any BECCS-related emission uptake, the extended post-
2050 energy scenarios are assumed to be consistent with other scenarios in which
emissions will be around zero by the end of the century. However, those other

the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Scenarios, i.e., red and purple dashed lines beyond 2050 in the upper panel)
or by keeping the percentile level within the literature-reported scenarios constant (in the case of

scenarios with zero emissions by the end of the century tend to reflect a much lower
level of mitigation effort. Therefore, to derive non-CO[^2]: emissions that involve a
level of effort that is comparable to the mitigation effort involved in reducing
energy-related CO[^2]: emissions, we assumed that the energy scenarios developed for
this study were comparable to other scenarios that share zero emissions around

2050. This percentile ‘stringency’ level was then held constant for the remainder of
the twenty-first century. Therefore, whereas the actual fossil and industrial CO2
emissions in the LDF scenarios are assumed to remain constant at zero, the non-CO2
gas emissions are derived from data in the existing literature, as if the scenarios
remained at a stringency level of ~3% in the second half of the twenty-first century
(see the lower panel in Fig. 3.13).
We now have the fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emission levels throughout the twenty-
first century for each of the three scenarios, and have complemented these with the
‘pseudo’ CO[^2]: emission levels for the second half of the twenty-first century.
Therefore, we can derive the corresponding non-CO[^2]: emissions.
In the first step, we derived the total non-CO[^2]: emissions for a specific year and
for the world as a whole. In the second step, we determined the shares of global fos-
sil and industrial emissions versus the land-use-related emissions—again regressed
against the overall fossil CO[^2]: emission level as an indicator of the ‘stringency’ of the
scenario. In the third step, we disaggregated these fossil and land-use-specific emis-
sion time series into regional time series. Again, the shares of the regional emissions
were derived with the same quantile regressions shown in Fig. 3.13 above. With
these three quantile regression steps, we inferred either the lower (if lower quantile
ranges are chosen), medium (for a median 50% quantile regression), or higher emis-
sion levels of the other gases. In this study, we do not intend to provide probabilistic
emission scenarios and therefore limited our quantile regression choice to the
median 50% setting for all regions, sectoral divisions, and other global total gases.
The major advantage of this newly developed method compared with the EQW
method developed earlier (Meinshausen et al. [^2006]:) is that the negative correlations
between CO[^2]: and other gases can also be taken into account. By performing all
quantile regressions in the space defined by the global fossil and industrial CO2
emissions in a particular year, any kind of non-linear, positive or negative relation-
ship with other non-CO[^2]: gas emission levels, sectoral divisions, or regional divi-
sions are automatically incorporated into the final result—reflecting the overall
characteristics of the chosen set of emission scenarios. Not all the 811 emission
scenarios contained details of all the sectoral and regional divisions, but the step-
wise approach of this method can incorporate the characteristics from all the sce-
narios in whatever detail is available.
Figure 3.14 shows sample distributions of the emission scenario characteristics for
the year 2040 and a subset of 21 GHGs. The x-axis of each plot shows the global fossil
and industrial CO[^2]: emissions, and the y-axis shows the global emission levels of
another GHG, with one marker (blue dot) for each literature-reported scenario consid-

ered. The five red lines are quantile regressions at the levels of 20%, 33%, 50%

(median), 66%, and 80% of the scenario distribution. It can be clearly seen that some

total gas emissions correlate strongly with the fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emissions

This method reflects the level of correlation in the finally derived multi-gas scenarios.

**3.8.1.5 Land-Use Assumptions**

In principle, the same methodological approach can be used for land-use emissions.

In the IAM scenarios, the emission sequestration with the BECCS technology is

reported as a negative emission in the fossil and industrial CO[^2]: emission categories.

Therefore, the quantile regression approach can also be applied to the land-use CO2
sector. However, to more explicitly define the land-use choices that are implied by
various land-use scenarios, we developed a new (probabilistic) scenario in conjunc-
tion with another land-use emission project (Dooley et al. [^2018]:)
This method is based on various literature-reported studies and we provide an
overall synthesis of four different land-use-based sequestration pathways: ‘forest
ecosystem restoration’, ‘reforestation’, ‘sustainable use of forests’, and ‘agrofor-
estry’. These land-use sequestration pathways are based on the premise that the
better management of terrestrial ecosystems should allow previously degraded car-
bon stocks to be restored, entailing the removal of significant atmospheric CO2
(DeCicco and Schlesinger [^2018]:; Law et  al. [^2018]:; Mackey et  al. [^2013]:; Mackey
[^2014]:; Nabuurs et al. [^2017]:). We derived the overall pathways separately for the tem-
perate and boreal regions on the one side and the subtropical and tropical regions on
the other. This distinction is largely consistent with the dominant distinction of dif-
ferent climate domain characteristics in the literature (Grace et al. [^2014]:; Houghton
and Nassikas [^2018]:; Pan et al. [^2011]:), although the temperate and boreal biomes are
as different in terms of land-use and forest ecosystem characteristics as the tropical
biomes are from each of them. However, we derived only two climate domains
because several of the RCP regions cross both temperate and boreal biomes. A nar-
rative for each of these pathways is available in Table 3.10 below.
Based on literature studies and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statis-
tics, we then defined the available areas (and their uncertainties) for each of the four
sequestration pathways. Similarly, we sourced average estimates of the maximal
annual sequestration rates for the biomes (and their levels of uncertainty) for those
four sequestration pathways—again distinguished in the large temperate/boreal and
subtropical/tropical climate domains. We assume that after a certain ‘phase-in
period’, this maximal annual sequestration rate can be reached and sustained for a
number of years. We assume that after some decades to centuries, the capacities of
these terrestrial ecosystems as carbon sinks will slowly decline until they reach
equilibrium, termed the ‘saturation’ period. At the equilibrium point, these ecosys-
tems have a net zero effect on atmospheric CO[^2]: over the time scales of interest here
(Houghton and Nassikas [^2018]:). The period over which the maximal sequestration
rate is assumed, is reduced by the half-length of the corresponding phase-in and
phase-out periods to account for the cumulative carbon uptake in those periods. As
the last element in this framework, we assume a cap on the median carbon density
change that is achieved over the full period. The difference between a degraded for-

```
Te,B Assume 25% of degraded natural forest put aside for full
ecosystem and carbon stock recovery. Saturation times in
temperate and boreal forests can be well over 100, or even
200 years (Luyssaert et al. 2008; Roxburgh et al. 2006).
25% set-aside is slightly higher than assumptions made in
recent literature (Böttcher et al. 2018; Nabuurs et al. 2017),
but in line with calls from conservation and indigenous
movements.
S,Tr Assume 25% of degraded natural forests across the tropics
set aside for full ecosystem and carbon stock recovery.
Stopping all deforestation, wood harvest and temporary
use, while traditional and customary uses continue. Net
Primary Productivity (NPP) is higher across the tropics
than in temperate and boreal biomes (Anav et al. 2015),
hence sequestration rates are higher, but saturation times
are shorter. We assume 60 years to ecosystem maturity
(Arneth et al. 2017; Poorter et al. 2016). Sequestration rates
across all biomes for forest ecosystem restoration are lower
than post-logging recovery rates, as here we assume mixed
age-class forests which have not been recently logged than
(>20 years ago), which then saturates when forest reaches
maturity.
Reforestation (forest
expansion through
natural regeneration)
```

```
Te Forest expansion on recently deforested land via natural
regeneration of forests (passive regeneration) or
reforestation of mixed native species (assisted
regeneration). Extent of forest expansion is assumed to
occur in line with current political targets: 350 Mha of
reforestation by 2030 under the Bonn Challenge. Further,
this 350 Mha is assumed to be reforestation for
conservation purposes, which creates an ongoing sink from
2030 to 2100, with saturation assumed at 100 years. Boreal
areas excluded due to albedo effect (Houghton and
Nassikas 2018).
S,Tr Natural forest expansion on recently deforested land as
described above. We assume 80% of forest expansion
occurs in the tropics, given 80% of Bonn Challenge pledges
are in tropical regions (Wheeler et al. in press). All
regeneration is assumed to be with natural forests rather
than plantations, as this delivers the highest mitigation and
biodiversity values (Grace et al., 2014; Wheeler et al. in
press). Saturation of tropical regrowth forests is assumed at
60 years, although large trees can take well over a century
to mature (Poorter et al. 2016).

est ecosystem and its natural carbon-carrying capacity is the maximum potential for

additional sequestration. Therefore, we used biome-averaged values for the per

hectare carbon density of undisturbed forest ecosystems (Keith et al. [^2009]:), rather

than average global biome values (Liu et al. [^2015]:), to define the maximum carbon

density. Although the LDF scenarios only extend to 2050 or to 2100 for all the other

GHGs, we modelled the land-use sequestration pathway assumptions until 2300 to

be able to apply the overall ‘added carbon density’ cap.

Our climate-domain- and sequestration-specific assumptions regarding the

median values, their uncertainty ranges, and confidence intervals are given in

Sustainable use of
forests (secondary

harvest )
```

```
Te,B Sustainable use of natural production forests (i.e. excluding
plantations) under continued wood harvest. Multiple studies
show the potential to double forest carbon stocks in
production forests through reducing harvest intensity and
extending rotation lengths (Law et al. 2018; Nabuurs et al.
2017; Pingoud et al. 2018). Wood harvest is slightly
reduced, requiring reduced demand for wood products,
more efficient wood use and compensation to land-owners
(Law et al. 2018; Pingoud et al. 2018). Including harvested
wood products (HWP) in calculations could increase
mitigation values (Houghton and Nassikas 2018; Nabuurs
et al. 2017), but the life-time of HWP is generally too short
to realise mitigation value compared to residence times in
forest biomass (Law et al. 2018; Keith et al. 2015).
S,Tr Reduced harvest intensity and management practices such
as reduced impact logging have not been shown to increase
carbon stock in tropical forests (Martin et al. 2015). Carbon
stocks are concentrated in commercially-valuable
hardwood trees taking >100 years to reach maturity; hence
selective logging as practiced across the tropics
significantly decreases standing carbon stocks (Lutz et al.
2018; Zimmerman and Kormos 2012). Our scenario
assumes no commercial logging of tropical forests, and the
extent of shifting cultivation is halved, allowing traditional
practices to continue with lengthened fallow times and/or
improved swidden practices (Mackey et al. 2018; Ziegler
et al. 2012).
Agroforestry (Trees in
croplands)
```

```
T,B We calculate biome-average sequestration rates from the
literature for above-ground carbon uptake due to a broad
range of agroforestry practices (Watson et al. 2000;
Nabuurs et al. 2017; Ramachandran Nair et al. 2009), and
subtract from this the baseline increase observed by Zomer
et al. (2016). We apply this uptake to 20% of permanent
cropland, and assume the resulting sequestration rate could
be sustained for 50 years (Watson et al. 2000).

These domains are defined as temperate (Te), boreal (B), subtropical (S), or tropical (Tr). Note, this
narrative overlaps with another land-use-related study (Dooley et al. [^2018]:)

Table 3.11. Our method of combining these input assumptions is a basic Monte Carlo
ensemble. Given the symmetry or asymmetry and respective confidence intervals of
the factors provided, we then created normal, lognormal, or skewed normal distribu-
tions (the latter is a linear combination of the normal and lognormal distributions to
achieve the desired skewedness). We then made 500 independent draws from all four
factors considered (area, maximum sequestration rate, phase-in time, and phase-out
time). We repeated that process independently for each sequestration pathway and
for each country within each climate domain. The areas for each country within the
climate domains were assumed to be proportionally distributed by the relevant ‘FAO
Scaling Area’ (see third column in Table 3.11), so that the climate domain aggregate
areas matched our input assumptions for the respective sequestration pathway.
After combining all the country-specific and sequestration-pathway-specific
time series for carbon uptake per sequestration pathway, we then checked whether
the resulting cumulative sequestration over time (specifically its median) was at or
below the specified maximum for the median carbon density change per hectare. If
it was not, we scaled all the country-specific results proportionally, so that the
median matched the cap on the carbon density gain.

**3.8.2 Model for the Assessment of GHG-Induced Climate**
**Change**

To compute GHG concentrations and the implications for radiative forcing, global
mean temperatures, and global mean sea-level rise, we used the reduced-complexity
‘Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas-induced Climate Change’
(MAGICC), as described by Meinshausen et  al. ([^2011]:). The model has recently
been extended by the addition of a newly designed sea-level rise module, as
described in Nauels et al. ([^2016]:).
The MAGICC model has at its core an upwelling-diffusion ocean with 50 layers,
in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Some simpler model approaches,
with only a diffusive one-box ocean, for example, tend to overestimate the medium-
term warming compared with the longer-term warming, (i.e., they tend to reach
equilibrium too quickly). In the short term, the MAGICC modelling structure pro-
vides faster warming, but a lower approach to equilibrium, due to the effective cool-
ing cycle that mimics the sinking polar ocean waters.
Although simple in its general structure, the MAGICC model uses a broad cover-

age of GHGs and aerosols. This is much broader than for earth system models,

because it would be too computationally expensive to carry around tracers for every

minute GHG concentrations of, say, HFC227EA.  Because of the breadth of the

GHGs that MAGICC can model, its calibrated carbon cycle, and its calibrated cli-

mate system with feedbacks and heat exchange parameterizations, it is frequently

used as a climate model in IAMs. For example, the IMAGE and MESSAGE teams

both have MAGICC inbuilt.

```
IPCC Assessment Reports also frequently use MAGICC as the modelling frame-

#### Mitigation Scenarios for Non-energy GHG

**Malte Meinshausen and Kate Dooley**

**Abstract** Presentation of non-energy emission pathways in line with the new
UNFCCC Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) scenario characteristics and the
evaluation of the multi-gas pathways against various temperature thresholds and
carbon budgets (1.5  °C and 2.0  °C) over time, and additionally against a 1.5  °C
carbon budget in 2100, followed by a discussion of the results in the context of the
most recent scientific literature in this field. Presentation of the non-energy GHG
mitigation scenarios calculated to complement the energy-related CO[^2]: emissions
derived in Chap. [^8]:.

In this section, we present the results for the land-use CO[^2]: and non-CO[^2]: emissions

pathways that complement the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C energy-related CO[^2]: scenarios.

**4.1 Land-Use CO**[^2]: **emissions**

This section presents the aggregate results for the land-use sequestration pathways
designed for this study. Figure 4.1 below shows the annual sequestration in the
sequestration pathways over time, differentiated into climate domains. The path-
ways shown are the results of the Monte Carlo analysis described in Table 3.11 in
Sect. 3.8.1.5 and the text. We focus on the median values (thick lines in Fig. 4.1).
Note that the area under the curve for a given pathway is an indication of the cumu-
lative CO[^2]: uptake. By far the most important sequestration may result from large-
scale reforestation measures, particularly in the subtropics and tropics (see yellow
pathways in Fig. 4.1 below). The second most important pathway in terms of the
amount of CO[^2]: sequestered is the sustainable use of existing forests, which basically
means reducing logging within those forests. Although effective mitigation is not

achieved in the tropics (Martin et  al. [^2015]:), in the temperate and boreal regions,

improved forest management could provide substantial additional carbon uptake

over time. The time horizon for this sequestration option is assumed to be relatively

long in temperate and boreal regions, consistent with the longer time it takes for

these forest ecosystems to reach equilibrium (Roxburgh et al. [^2006]:; Luyssaert et al.

[^2008]:). The ‘forest ecosystem restoration’ pathway is also important, which basi-

cally assumes a reduction to zero in logging rates in a fraction of the forest, allowing

these forests to be restored to full ecosystem function, including their carbon stocks

and resilience due to biodiversity (Mackey [^2014]:).

```
Overall, the median of all the assumed sequestration pathways, shown in Fig. 4.1,
```

would result in the sequestration of 151.9 GtC by 2150. This is approximately equiv-

alent to all historical land-use-related CO[^2]: emissions to date (Houghton and Nassikas
[^2017]:; Mackey et al. [^2013]:). The magnitude of these figures indicates the substantial

challenges that go hand in hand with these sequestration pathways. Given the com-
peting forms of land use that exist today, the challenge of converting overall terres-
trial carbon stocks back to pre-industrial levels cannot be underestimated. There
would be significant benefits, but also risks, if this sequestration option were to be
used instead of mitigation. The benefits are clearly manifold, ranging from biodiver-
sity protection, reduced erosion, improved local climates, wind protection, and
potentially a reduction in air pollution (Mackey [^2014]:). Despite this, terrestrial car-
bon sequestration is inherently impermanent. However, a future warming climate
with an increased fire risk also brings with it the risk of large reversals in sequestered
carbon. Similarly, prolonged droughts in some areas could reverse the gains in ter-
restrial carbon stocks. Although the increased resilience of natural and biodiverse
ecosystems compared with that of monoculture plantations can guard against this

risk (DellaSala, [^2019]:; Lindenmayer and Sato [^2018]:), a future mitigation pathway
that relies on sequestration _instead of mitigation action_ is ultimately always more
susceptible to higher long-term climate change, given the risk of ‘non-permanence’.
However, in this study, the land-use CO[^2]: sequestration pathways complement some
of the most ambitious mitigation pathways, and should therefore be regarded, not as
‘offsetting’ mitigation action, but as complementary measures to help reduce the
CO[^2]: concentrations that have arisen from the overly high emissions in the past.
The thin lines in Fig. 4.1 indicate individual draws in the Monte Carlo analysis.
The thick lines are the median values from the ensemble of draws for each seques-
tration pathway and domain.
We aggregated the four sequestration pathways from our country-level data to
the five RCP regions (Fig. 4.2). The country-level data were subject to substantial
uncertainties and simplifications because we used climate-domain average uptakes,
carbon density caps, and saturation periods. The re-aggregated sequestration rates
over the five RCP regions can be considered approximate illustrations of the biome-
average sequestration rates if those sequestration pathways were pursued with a
range of institutional and policy measures.
For the 1.5 °C Scenario, we assumed the full extent of sequestration shown in
Fig. 4.1, whereas for the 2.0  °C pathway, we assumed that only a third of that
sequestration will occur. The reference scenario is assumed to follow the SSP2
‘middle of the road’ reference scenario created by the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM
modelling team. As illustrated in Fig. 4.2, the reference scenario does not assume a
complete phasing-out of global land-use-related net emissions over the next 20 or
30 years. Instead, it assumes that they are not phased-out until approximately 2080.
The 2.0  °C pathway (brighter blue in Fig. 4.2) aligns relatively well with the
SSP1 1.9 and SSP1 2.6 scenarios from the forthcoming CMIP6 model inter-
comparison project. The 1.5 °C pathway, with three times the sequestration rates, is
consistent with the lower land-use CO[^2]: scenarios analysed here—with mitigation
rates of up to −2 GtC per annum from 2040 to 2050.
Figure 4.2 shows the land-use-related CO[^2]: emission and sequestration rates of
the 2.0°C and 1.5  °C pathways in this study compared with those in the CMIP6
CEDS scenarios (turquoise) and the scenarios from the IPCC SR1.5 database (thin
green lines). The global total pathway is the sum of the five regional pathways
shown in the lower row of the panels.

**4.1.1 Other GHG and Aerosol Emissions**

This section examines the other main GHGs (methane and N[^2]:O) and gives examples
of some fluorinated gases. The full results, with the species-by-species time series,
are provided in a data appendix.
Methane (CH[^4]:) emissions are the second-largest contributor to anthropogenically
induced climate change. Our approach, described in the Methods section earlier,

derives pathways for the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Scenarios that are close to the lower end

of the overall scenario distribution. This is mainly because the methane distribution at

the lower end of the fossil fuel CO[^2]: emissions is relatively narrow, and there is a
strong correlation between the fossil CO[^2]: and total CH[^4]: emissions in the scenarios in
any given year (see top-left methane panel in Fig. 3.14). As with almost all literature-
reported scenarios, a lower plateau of methane emissions is associated with agricul-
tural activities required to feed the world’s population. Our quantile regression method
resulted in long-term methane emission levels that are quite similar to those in the two
lower SSP scenarios, SSP1 1.9 and SSP1 2.6 (Fig. 4.3). The derived CH[^4]: pathways for
1.5 °C and 2.0 °C track towards the lower of the scenario distributions.
Nitrous oxide (N[^2]:O) is one of the longer-lived GHGs, although the overall
amounts in the atmosphere are much smaller than those of methane or CO[^2]:. The
relatively high plateau of global emissions, around 5 MtN[^2]:O-N for N[^2]:O, are reflected
in the SSP1. 1.9 and SSP1 2.6 scenarios (dark green lines in Fig. 4.4) and in the
quantile regression results for the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C scenarios in this study. This
plateau of emissions is related to agricultural activities, mainly the use of fertilizers,
and combined with the long lifetime of N[^2]:O, it means that the N[^2]:O concentrations
are projected to increase further over the course of the century, even for the lower
1.5 °C and 2.0 °C pathways.
The derived methane pathways for 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C track towards the lower of
the scenario distributions.
Halocarbons and fluorinated gases are another group of important GHGs.
Recently, some of these gases, such as HFCs, were also subjected to control under
the Montreal Protocol, with clear phase-out schedules. Some of the halocarbons and
fluorinated gases (such as tetrafluoromethane, CF[^4]:) are only produced and emitted
in relatively small quantities—largely for industrial purposes in the semi-conductor
industry. Some also have applications in the agricultural sector, including methyl
bromide, which is used for soil fumigation. SF[^6]: is one of the strongest GHGs on a
per mass basis. It is controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and included in the nation-

ally determined contributions (NDCs) by many countries under the Paris Agreement.

Our applied quantile regression method practically phases-out many of the haloge-

nated species over the course of the next 10–20 years, although some small back-

ground emissions remain. The full results for 40 halocarbons, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6
are provided in a data appendix (Figs. 4.5 and 4.6).

Aerosols have an important temporary masking effect on GHG-induced warm-
ing. The most important anthropogenically emitted aerosol coolant in the climate
system is sulfur dioxide or SOX. With higher fuel standards and concerns about local
air pollution, future SOX emissions are projected to be substantially lower than cur-
rent levels. In fact, most emission inventories assume that SOX emissions peaked in
the 1990s. Therefore, even in the most high-fossil-fuel-emitting reference scenarios,
SOX emissions are projected to decrease. Asia produces by far the most SOX emis-
sions of any continent because of the coal-fuelled power plants in China and India.
In the 2.0 °C Scenario, our quantile regression method sets sulfate aerosol emissions
at levels in between those in the SSP1 2.6 and SSP1 1.9 scenarios, whereas in the
1.5 °C Scenario, the level is even lower.
Similarly, the projected emissions of NOX, which is largely a by-product of fossil
fuel burning, are highest in Asia. In the derived 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Scenarios, NOX

levels are between the levels in the SSP1 2.6 and SSP1 1.9 scenarios for most of the
twenty-first century (Figs. 4.7 and 4.8).
Black and organic carbon emissions are also accruing substantially in the Middle
East and Africa, largely from biomass burning (Figs. 4.9 and 4.10). Similar to other
aerosol emissions, black and organic carbon emissions are projected to decrease.
Although black carbon is a substantial warming agent, organic carbon is a net cool-
ant. Because both species are often co-emitted, the net effect of policies to reduce
black carbon do not have as large a mitigation benefit as might be initially assumed.
This is because a reduction in the processes and activities that produce black carbon
emissions will also lead to lower organic carbon emissions, partially offsetting both
the warming and cooling effects. The emissions projected as part of the IMAGE
model SSP1 2.6 and SSP1 1.9 scenarios are very low compared with those in other
studies. Furthermore, the correlation between fossil CO[^2]: emissions and black or

organic carbon is less pronounced than the correlations of fossil CO[^2]: with other
aerosols, such as NOX and SOX, partly because it results from biomass burning,
which is not related to the burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, with our quantile

regression method, the black carbon and organic carbon emission pathways are not

as low as those found in the lower SSP scenarios (see Figs. 4.9 and 4.10).

#### Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

**Thomas Pregger, Sonja Simon, Tobias Naegler, and Sven Teske**

**Abstract** The aim of this chapter is to make the scenario calculations fully trans-

parent and comprehensible to the scientific community. It provides the scenario

narratives for the reference case (5.0 °C) as well as for the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C on a

global and regional basis. Cost projections for all fossil fuels and renewable energy

technologies until 2050 are provided. Explanations are given for all relevant base

year data for the modelling and the main input parameters such as GDP, population,

renewable energy potentials and technology parameters.

Scenario studies cannot predict the future, but they can describe what is needed for a

successful pathway in terms of technology implementation and investments. Scenarios

also help us to explore the possible effects of transition processes, such as supply

costs and emissions. The energy demand and supply scenarios in this study are based

on information about current energy structures and today’s knowledge of energy

resources and the costs involved in deploying them. As far as possible, we also take

into account potential constraints and preferences in each world region. However, this

remains difficult due to large sub-regional variations. Our energy modelling primarily

aims to achieve a transparent and consistent scenario, an ambitious but still plausible

storyline from several possible techno-economic pathways. Knowledge integration

is the core of this approach because we must consider different technical,

economic, environmental, and societal factors. The scenario modelling follows a

hybrid bottom-up/top-down approach, with no cost optimising objective functions.

The analysis considers the key technologies required for a successful energy transi-

tion, and focuses on the roles and potential of renewable energies. Wind and solar

energies have the highest economic potential and dominate the pathways on the

supply side. However, variable renewable power from wind and photovoltaics (PV)

remains limited by the need for sufficient secured capacity in energy systems.

Therefore, we also consider concentrated solar power (CSP) with high-temperature

heat storage as a solar option that promises large-scale dispatchable and secured

power generation.

**5.1 Scenario Definition**

Scenario modelling was performed for three main scenarios that can be related to dif-

ferent overall carbon budgets between 2015 and 2050 and derived mean global tem-

perature increases. The (around) 5.0 °C Scenario was calculated based on the Current

Policies scenario published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in World

Energy Outlook 2017 (IEA [^2017]:), and the emission budget for this scenario simply

uses and extrapolates from the corresponding narratives. The 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

Scenarios were calculated in a normative way to achieve defined emission budgets.

**5.1.1 The 5.0 °C Scenario (Reference Scenario)**

The reference case only takes into account existing international energy and envi-

ronmental policies. Its assumptions include, for example, continuing progress in

electricity and gas market reforms, the liberalization of cross-border energy trade,

and recent policies designed to combat environmental pollution. The scenario does

not include additional policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because

the IEA’s projections only extend to 2040, we have extrapolated their key macroeco-

nomic and energy indicators forward to 2050. This provides a baseline for compari-

son with the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios.

**5.1.2 The 2.0 °C Scenario**

The first alternative scenario aims to achieve an ambitious emissions reduction to

zero by 2050 and a global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions budget between 2015 and
2050 of around 590 Gt. The scenario is close to the assumptions and results of the

Advanced E[R] scenario published in 2015 by Greenpeace (Teske et  al. [^2015]:).
However, the scenario includes an updated base year, more coherent regional devel-
opments of energy intensities, and reconsidered trajectories and shares of renewable
energy resource (RES) deployment. The 2.0  °C Scenario represents a far more
likely pathway than the 1.5 °C Scenario, because the 2.0 °C case takes into account
unavoidable delays due to political, economic, and societal processes and
stakeholders.

```

**5.1.3 The 1.5 °C Scenario**

The second alternative scenario aims to achieve a global energy-related CO[^2]: emis-
sion budget of around 450 Gt, accumulated between 2015 and 2050. The 1.5  °C

Scenario requires immediate action to realize all available options. It is a technical
pathway, not a political prognosis. It refers to technically possible measures and
options without taking into account societal risks or barriers. Efficiency and renew-
able potentials must be deployed even more quickly than in the 2.0  °C Scenario.
Furthermore, avoiding inefficient technologies and behaviours are essential strate-
gies for developing regions in this time period.

**5.2 Scenario World Regions and Clusters**

The regional implementation of the long-term energy scenarios is defined according

to the breakdown of the ten world regions of the IEA WEO 2016 (IEA 2016a, b).

This approach has been chosen because the IEA also provides the most comprehen-
sive global energy statistics and, in contrast to the regional breakdown of the IEA
WEO 2017, it is also consistent with the Energy [R]evolution study series. Table 5.1
provides a country breakdown of the ten world regions considered in the scenarios.
Regional conditions play an important role in the layout of the scenario path-
ways. Therefore, scenario building tries to take into account important factors, such
as current demand and supply structures, RES potentials, urbanization rates, and as
far as possible, societal and behavioural factors. The following sections provide
some regional information. Statistical data for the energy systems in the regions can
be found in Sect. 5.3.

**5.2.1 OECD North America**

The energy system in OECD North America (USA, Canada, and Mexico) is domi-

nated by developments in the USA, where more than 80% of the region’s demand

occurs. In the highly developed countries of the USA and Canada, reducing the

demand for energy by increasing efficiency will play a crucial role in decarbonisa-

tion. However, the high energy intensity (i.e., the high demand per capita or per

gross domestic product [GDP]) requires even more ambitious measures than in

other regions to reduce the energy demand as quickly as possible. In Mexico, in

contrast, increasing living standards and the increasing population will increase the

difficulties associated with reducing the energy demand, despite ambitious increases

in efficiency. Wind and solar power generation will be the backbone of the power

supply in OECD North America. They will be supplemented by hydro power

(mainly in Canada) and also concentrated solar power (CSP). The high potential for

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

CSP in Mexico and the southern parts of the USA will allow the large-scale use of

CSP plants for grid balancing and grid stabilization. This will reduce the need for

power storage, demand-side management, and other balancing strategies. In the

large metropolitan areas in North America, electromobility and hydrogen cars will

enter the market earlier and at a faster rate than in many other world regions. Large

biomass potentials (residues) mean that biofuels could play important roles as

climate-neutral fuels to bridge the gap until new powertrain technologies dominate

the vehicle market. In the heating sector, particularly for process heat, solid biomass

and biogas will be required as alternative fuels until the (direct or indirect) electrifi-

cation of the heat sector is accomplished.

**5.2.2 Latin America**

Latin America’s energy system is dominated by Brazil, which accounts for around

half the region’s energy demand. In the reference (5.0 °C) scenario, this region has a

particularly high demand for electrification and a strong increase in CO[^2]: emissions
per capita. Latin America has the highest urbanization rate of all non-OECD regions.

This provides opportunities for efficiency measures and the large-scale electrification
of the heat and transport sectors based on renewable resources. Latin America has a
high overall potential for the use of renewable energies (Herreras Martínez et  al.
[^2015]:) and the largest biomass potential of all regions. It already meets more than
60% of its power demand from renewable sources, and higher shares are the focus of
research (Nascimento et al. [^2017]:; Barbosa et al. [^2017]:; Gils et al. [^2017]:). However, in
many studies, heat and transport demands are not integrated into the assessments,
even though the region has a large potential for renewable heat and decarbonised
transport. Given the abundance of biomass, there is potential for generating more
than 12 EJ from residues (Seidenberger et al. [^2008]:). Biomass will also play a signifi-
cant role in the industry sector. Because the region has a long experience of biofuels,
they will play a major role in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, especially in Brazil,
where bioethanol for transport is already competitive (Lora and Andrade [^2009]:; La
Rovere et al. [^2011]:; Nass et al. [^2007]:). However, the high urbanization rate in Latin
America means there is also an opportunity to develop electromobility early. In the
power sector, the use of biomass from residues will help to balance the increasing
share of variable renewable energy from the excellent solar and wind resources. Grid
extensions will contribute to inter-regional stability (Nascimento et al. [^2017]:).

**5.2.3 OECD Europe**

The OECD Europe region includes countries with quite different energy supply

systems, different potentials for renewable energy sources, and different power and

heat demand patterns. High solar potentials and low heat demand for buildings are

characteristic of the south. The northern and western parts of Europe have high wind

potentials, especially offshore wind. In northern and central Europe, there are high

potentials for hydropower and a high energy demand for space heating (such as in

Eastern Europe). Biomass potentials exist predominantly in the north and east, but

are only limited in the southern regions. The industrial demands for electricity and

process heat are quite different in highly industrialized countries, such as the

Scandinavian countries, Germany, and France compared with some eastern and

southern countries. Most European countries, particularly European Union (EU)

member countries, already have policies and market mechanisms for the

implementation of renewable energy. The European Network of Transmission

System Operators (ENTSO-E) can be used as a well-established basis for the further

development of an interconnected European grid, which would be able to imple-

ment the large-scale and long-range transmission of renewable power to demand

centres. This may also lead to important interconnections to the Middle East/North

Africa (MENA) region and Eastern Europe/Eurasia. The possible large-scale impor-

tation of solar thermal electricity from MENA countries via high-voltage direct-

current lines has been described in many studies and still represents a promising

option in the long term, despite the currently difficult political conditions.

**5.2.4 Eastern Europe/Eurasia**

The Eastern Europe/Eurasia region includes some eastern EU member countries that

are not part of the OECD, some other countries of the former Yugoslav Republic, and

several countries of the former Soviet Union. However, the region is dominated by

the economy and energy system of Russia. The main energy carrier today is natural

gas, followed by oil. The region has large energy resources in biomass and wind

power, but also geothermal energy and PV. Eastern Europe/Eurasia is the only world

region that may face a significant population decline with expected demographic

developments, particularly in Russia. Today, the region has by far the highest final

and primary energy demand per $GDP.  This indicates the existence of energy-

intensive industries, but also large efficiency potentials in all sectors. The high heat

demand, large rural areas, enormous oil and natural gas potentials, and the uneven

distribution of economic wealth are some of the major challenges in this region. So

far, only low expansion rates for renewable energies have been achieved in the region.

**5.2.5 The Middle East**

The Middle East consists of a series of oil-dependent countries, all of which have

tremendous solar potential. The transport demand in the Middle East is very high,

as is the electrification rate in urban areas, where currently almost 70% of the fast-

growing population lives. Therefore, the electrification of transport systems is a

major target in our scenarios. For many Middle East countries, water scarcity is a

problem, and there are opportunities to combine large CSP plants with water

desalination, to reduce the pressure on water supply systems. Biomass is very

scarce, so its use must be limited to high-temperature process heat, especially in

industry, where other renewable sources cannot be used. This will lead to a high

demand for hydrogen or synthetic fuels. Naturally, this also limits the potential for

combined heat and power generation (CHP), which is primarily seen as a transi-

tion technology to provide the most efficient use of the remaining fossil fuels and

low-value biomass wastes. However, because the Middle East has extraordinary

solar and wind potentials (Nematollahi et al. [^2016]:; Hess [^2018]:), the solar market is

```

```

```

```

taking off. Projects with a capacity of 11 GW are planned for 2018 (MESIA [^2018]:).

With the extraordinarily high number of full-load hours, there is also the potential

to use high-temperature solar heat. These resources also provide excellent condi-

tions for hydrogen production, which are extensively exploited in the 2.0 °C and

the 1.5 °C Scenarios. Therefore, the Middle East is a model solar and hydrogen

region.

**5.2.6 Africa**

Africa is a very heterogeneous region, both economically and geographically. One

of the few things African nations have in common is their very fast population

growth. Africa includes the arid regions of North Africa, the undeveloped sub-

Saharan region, and the emerging market of South Africa. North Africa features a

high electrification rate and a strong dependence on oil. The water and biomass

potentials for energy are very low, because water and biomass are prioritized for

nutrition (or at least nutrition competes strongly with energy use). The region has

outstanding solar irradiation, an excellent renewable energy source. Sub-Saharan

Africa is characterized by low urbanization and a lack of access to electricity for

two-thirds of its people (IEA [^2014]:). Its energy supply is characterized by a high

share of low-efficiency forms of generation, such as traditional biomass use. There

is a general lack of energy services. Modernizing traditional biomass use could lead

to significant reductions in energy demand, while maintaining or improving energy

services (van der Zwaan et al. [^2018]:). A broad variety of renewable energy sources,

including biomass, hydro, geothermal, solar, and wind, have great potential.

However, it will be a major challenge to find the investment required to tap these

power sources under the present economic conditions (van der Zwaan et al. [^2018]:).

The picture is somewhat different in South Africa, which has a coal-based energy

system and a comparatively stable and well-connected electricity grid, with access

to electricity for more than 85% of its population (IEA [^2014]:). The dependence on

traditional biomass is extensive in the household and commerce sectors. Over 700

million people rely on fuel wood or charcoal for cooking on inefficient cooking

stoves or open fires, with an efficiency of 10–20%. Modern biomass technologies

provide multiple advantages. The introduction of more-efficient technologies, even

those as simple as improved cooking stoves (with an average efficiency of 25%) or

biogas stoves (with an average efficiency of 65%) (IEA [^2014]:), will reduce the bio-

mass input and thus the primary energy demand. This will also alleviate the heavy

pressure on the ecosystem from the unsustainable exploitation of natural forests.

The introduction of modern technologies will improve the supply of useful energy,

lower indoor pollution, and improve living standards. Therefore, we assume in our

scenarios that the overall biomass efficiency will improve from 35% in 2015 to 65%

in 2050, while biomass’s share will decrease and be partially replaced by electric

power and solar heat.

**5.2.7 Non-OECD Asia**

The Non-OECD Asia region includes all the developing countries of Asia, except

China and India. This group covers a large spectrum in terms of size, economy,

stability, and developmental status. The region is spread over a large area from the

Arabian Sea to the Pacific. Electricity access varies widely in these countries,

according to WEO 2014. In Southeast Asia, the average access is 77%, with only

30% access in Myanmar and Cambodia, and nearly 100% access in Singapore,

Thailand, and Vietnam. In Indonesia, there is 76% access (92% in urban areas), in

Bangladesh 60% (90%), and in Pakistan 69% (88%). In Southeast Asia, 46% of the

population still relies on traditional biomass, with the highest use in Myanmar

(93%) and Cambodia (89%). In Indonesia, 42% of the population used biomass for

cooking in 2012; in Bangladesh the figure was 89%; and in Pakistan, it was 62%.

The lowest values are in Singapore (0%), Malaysia (0%), and Thailand (24%). The

scenarios thus cover the whole band-width of renewable resources and technologi-

cal development, even though the outlooks for individual countries deviate widely

from the average.

**5.2.8 India**

India has a fast-growing population of over 1.2 billion people and is the world’s

seventh largest country by area. However, the population density is already 2.7

times higher than that in China. Due to its climate, India has a rather limited CSP

potential but a large potential for PV power generation. Its wind power potential is

expected to be limited by land-use constraints, but the technical potential estimated

from available meteorological data is large. According to the WEO 2014 database,

electricity access is on average 75%, with 94% in urban areas and 67% in rural

areas. In India, about 815 million people still relied on the traditional use of biomass

for cooking in 2012. Due to population and GDP growth, increasing living stan-

dards, and increasing mobility, it is expected that the energy demand in India will

increase significantly, although large potentials for efficiency savings exist.

Electrification is a core strategy for decarbonisation in India, which, combined with

the rising demand for energy services, will lead to strong growth in the per capita

and overall electricity demand. It is also expected that the need for mobility in India

will increase rapidly and more strongly than in other regions of the world.

**5.2.9 China**

China has great potential renewable energy resources, especially for the generation

of solar thermal power in the west, onshore wind in the north, and offshore wind in

the east and southeast. Photovoltaic power generation could play an important role

```
T. Pregger et al.
```

```
101
```

throughout all parts of China. The expansion of hydropower generation is currently

also seen as a major strategy, but the potential for small hydro systems is rather low.

China will face further large increases in energy demand in all sectors of the energy

system. Chinese economic prosperity has mainly been underpinned by coal, which

provides over two-thirds of China’s primary energy supply today (IEA WEO [^2014]:).

The increase in electricity use due to higher electrification rates will be a major fac-

tor in the successful expansion of renewable energy in the industry, building, and

transport sectors. In China, nearly all households are connected to the electricity

grid. However, according to WEO 2014, about 450 million Chinese still relied on

the traditional use of biomass for cooking in 2012. China has pledged to reduce CO2
emissions before 2030, and already has some ambitious political targets for renew-

able energy deployment.

**5.2.10 OECD Pacific**

OECD Pacific consists of Japan, New Zealand, the peninsula of South Korea, and

the continent of Australia. The region is dominated by the high energy demand in

Japan, which has rather limited renewable energy resources. The lack of physical

grid connections prevents power transmission between these countries. Therefore, it

is a huge effort to supply the large Japanese nation with renewable energy and to

stabilize the variable wind power without tapping the large solar potential in other

countries, such as Australia. Here, hydrogen and synfuels will not only be used for

the long-term storage of renewable power, but also as an option for balancing the

renewable energy supply across borders. The early market introduction of fuel-cell

cars in Japan may support such a strategy. Following the accident at Fukushima and

the implementation of feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity, the expansion rates

for renewable energies, in particular PV, have risen sharply.

**5.3 Key Assumptions for Scenarios**

**5.3.1 Population Growth**

Population growth is an important driver of energy demand, directly and through its

impact on economic growth and development. The assumptions made in this study

up to 2050 are based on United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projec-

tions for population growth (UNDP [^2017]: (medium variant)). Table 5.2 shows that

according to the UNDP, the world’s population is expected to grow by 0.8% per

year on average over the period 2015–2050. The global population will increase

from 7.4 billion people in 2015 to nearly 9.8 billion by 2050. The rate of population

growth will slow over this period, from 1.1% per year during 2015–2020 to 0.6%

per year during 2040–2050. From a regional perspective, Africa’s population growth

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

102

will continue to be the most rapid (on average 2.2%/year), followed by the Middle
East (1.3%/year). In contrast, in China and OECD Pacific, a population decline of
about 0.1%/year. is expected. The populations in OECD Europe and OECD North
America are expected to increase slowly through to 2050. The proportion of the
population living in today’s non-OECD countries will increase from its current 81%
to 85% in 2050. China’s contribution to the world population will drop from 19%
today to 15% in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the highest population
growth, leading to a share of 26% of world population in 2050. Satisfying the energy
needs of a growing population in the developing regions of the world in an environ-
mentally friendly manner is the fundamental challenge in achieving a sustainable
global energy supply.

**5.3.2 GDP Development**

Economic growth is a key driver of energy demand. Since 1971, each 1% increase
in the global GDP has been accompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary energy
consumption. Therefore, the decoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is a
prerequisite for the rapid decarbonisation of the global energy industry. In this
study, the economic growth in the model regions is measured in GDP, expressed in
terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Purchasing power parities
compare the costs in different currencies of fixed baskets of traded and non-traded
goods and services. GDP PPP is a widely used measure of living standards and is
independent of currency exchange rates, which might not reflect a currency’s true
value (purchasing power) within a country. Therefore, GDP PPP is an important
basis of comparison when analysing the main drivers of energy demand or when
comparing the energy intensities of countries.

Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared with statistics
based on national incomes, trade, and national price indices, it is argued that they
provide a better basis for global scenario development. Therefore, all the data on
economic development in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2016 (WEO 2016a, b)
refer to purchasing-power-adjusted GDP in international US$ (2015).  However,
because WEO 2016 only covers the time period up to 2040, projections for 2040–
2050 in the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios are based on German Aerospace
Center (DLR) estimates, which are mainly used to extrapolate the GDP trends in the
world regions used in our modelling.
GDP growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over the coming decades
(Table 5.3). It is assumed that world GDP will grow on average by 3.2% per year
over the period 2015–2050. China, India, and Africa are expected to grow faster
than other regions, followed by the Middle East, Africa, other non-OECD Asia, and
Latin America. The growth of the Chinese economy will slow as it becomes more
mature, but it will nonetheless become the economically strongest region in the
world in PPP terms by 2020. The GDP in OECD Europe and OECD Pacific is
assumed to grow by 1.3–1.5% per year over the projection period, while economic
growth in OECD North America is expected to be slightly higher (2.1%). The
OECD’s share of global PPP-adjusted GDP will decrease from 45% in 2015 to 28%
in 2050.

**5.3.3 Technology Cost Projections**

The parameterization of the models requires many assumptions about the develop-
ment of the particular characteristics of technologies, such as specific investment
and fuel costs. Therefore, because long-term projections are highly uncertain, we
must define plausible and transparent assumptions based on background informa-
tion and up-to-date statistical and technical information.
The speed of an energy system transition also depends on overcoming economic
barriers. These largely relate to the relationships between the costs of renewable
technologies and their fossil and nuclear counterparts. For our scenarios, the projec-
tion of these costs is vital in making valid comparisons of energy systems. However,
there have been significant limitations to these projections in the past in relation to
investment and fuel costs.
In addition, efficiency measures also generate costs which are usually difficult to
determine depending on technical, structural and economic boundary conditions. In
the context of this study, we have therefore assumed uniform average costs of 3 ct
per avoided kWh of electricity consumption in our cost accounting.
During the last decade, fossil fuel prices have seen huge fluctuations. Figure 5.1
shows oil prices since 1997. After extremely high oil prices in 2012, we are cur-
rently in a low-price phase. Gas prices saw similar development (IEA [^2017]:).
Therefore, fossil fuel price projections have also seen considerable variations (IEA
[^2013]:, [^2017]:) and have had a considerable influence on scenario results ever since.
Although in the past, oil-exporting countries provided the best oil price projec-
tions, institutional price projections have become increasingly accurate, with the
International Energy Agency (IEA) leading the way in 2018 (Roland Berger [^2018]:).

```

An evaluation of the oil price projections of the IEA since 2000 by Wachtmeister
et  al. ([^2018]:) showed that price projections have varied significantly over time.
Whereas the IEA’s oil production projections seem comparatively accurate, oil price
projections showed errors of 40–60%, even when made for only 10  years ahead.
Between 2007 and 2017, the IEA price projections for 2030 varied from $70 to
$140 per barrel, providing significant uncertainty regarding future costs in the sce-
narios. Despite this limitation, the IEA provides a comprehensive set of price
projections. Therefore, we based our scenario assumptions on these projections, as
described below.
However, because most renewable energy technologies provide energy without
fuel costs, the projections of investment costs become more important than fuel cost
projections, and this limits the impact of errors in the fuel price projections. It is
only for biomass that the cost of feedstock remains a crucial economic factor for
renewables. Today, these costs range from negative costs for waste wood (based on
credit for the waste disposal costs avoided), through inexpensive residual materials,
to comparatively expensive energy crops. Because bioenergy holds significant mar-
ket shares in all sectors in many regions, a detailed assessment of future price pro-
jections is provided below.
Investment cost projections also pose challenges for scenario development.
Available short-term projections of investment costs depend largely on the data
available for existing and planned projects. Learning curves are most commonly
used to assess the future development of investment costs as a function of their
future installations and markets (McDonald and Schrattenholzer [^2001]:; Rubin et al.
[^2015]:). Therefore, the reliability of cost projections largely depends on the uncer-
tainty of future markets and the availability of historical data.
Fossil technologies provide a large cost data set featuring well-established mar-

kets and large annual installations. They are also mature technologies, where many

cost reduction potentials have already been exploited.

For renewable technologies, the picture is more mixed. For example, hydro

power is, like fossil fuels, well established and provides reliable data on investment

costs. Other technologies, such as PV and wind, are currently experiencing tremen-

dous developments in installation and cost reduction. Solar PV and wind are the

focus of cost monitoring, and considerable data are already available on existing

projects. However, their future markets are not easily predicted, as can be seen from

the evolution of IEA market projections over recent years in the World Energy

Outlook series (compare for example IEA [^2007]:, [^2014]:, [^2017]:). For PV and wind,

small differences in cost assumptions will lead to large deviations in the overall

costs, and cost assumptions must be made with special care. Furthermore, many

technologies feature only comparably small markets, such as geothermal, modern

bioenergy applications, and CSP, for which costs are still high and for which future

markets are insecure. The cost reduction potential is correspondingly high for these

technologies. This is also true for technologies that might become important in a

transformed energy system but are not yet widely available. Hydrogen production,

ocean power, and synthetic fuels might deliver important technology options in the

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

106

long term after 2040, but their cost reduction potential cannot be assessed with any

certainty today.

Thus, cost assumptions are a crucial factor in evaluating scenarios. Because costs

are an external input into the model and are not internally calculated, we assume the

same progressive cost developments for all scenarios. In the next sections, we pres-

ent a detailed overview of our assumptions for power and renewable heat technolo-

gies, including the investment and fuel costs, and the potential CO[^2]: costs in the
scenarios.

**5.3.3.1 Power and CHP Technologies**

The focus of cost calculations in our scenario modelling is the power sector. We
compared the specific investment costs estimated in previous studies (Teske et al.
[^2012]:, [^2015]:), which were based on a variety of studies, including the European
Commission-funded NEEDS project (NEEDS [^2009]:), projections from the European
Renewable Energy Council (Zervos et al. [^2010]:), investment cost projections by the
IEA ([^2014]:), and current cost assumptions by IRENA and IEA (IEA 2016b). We
found that investment costs generally converged, except for PV. Therefore, for con-
sistency reasons, the investment costs and operation and maintenance costs for the
power sector are based primarily on the investment costs within WEO 2016 (IEA
2016b) up to 2040, including their regional disaggregation. We extended the projec-
tions until 2050 based on the trends in the preceding decade.
For renewable power production, we used investment costs from the 450  ppm
scenario from IEA 2016b. For technologies not distinguished in the IEA report
(such as geothermal CHP), we used cost assumptions based on our own research,
from the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 2015 (Teske et al. [^2015]:). As the cost assump-
tions for PV systems by the IEA do not reflect recent cost degressions, we based our
assumptions on a more recent analysis by Steurer et al. ([^2018]:), which projects lower
investment costs for PV in 2050 than does the IEA. The costs for onshore and off-
shore wind in Europe were adapted from the same source, in order to reflect more
recent data. The cost assumptions for hydrogen production come from our own
analysis in the PlanDelyKaD project (Michalski et al. [^2017]:). Table 5.4 summarizes
the cost trends for power technologies derived from the assumptions discussed
above for OECD Europe. It is important to note that the cost reductions are, in real-
ity, not a function of time, but of cumulative capacity (production of units), so
dynamic market development is required to achieve a significant reduction in spe-
cific investment costs. Therefore, we might underestimate the costs of renewables in
the reference (5.0  °C) scenario compared with the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios.
However, our approach is conservative when we compare the reference scenario
with the 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cost assumptions for the other nine regions
are in the same range, but differ slightly for different renewable energy technolo-
gies. Fossil fuel power plants have a limited potential for cost reductions because
they are at an advanced stage of technology and market development. Gas and oil

```

plants are relatively cheap, at around $670/kW and $822/kW, respectively. CHP

applications and coal plants are more expensive, ranging between $2000/kW and

$2500/kW. The IEA sees some cost reduction potential for expensive nuclear plants,

tending towards $4500/kW by 2050, whereas gas might even increase in cost.

```
In contrast, several renewable technologies have seen considerable cost reduc-
```

tions over the last decade. This is expected to continue if renewables are deployed

extensively. Fuel cells are expected to outpace other CHP technologies, with a cost

reduction potential of more than 75% (from currently high costs). Hydro power and

biomass remain stable in terms of costs. Tremendous cost reductions are still

expected for solar energy and offshore wind, even though they have experienced

significant reductions already. Although CSP might deliver dispatchable power at

half its current cost in 2050, variable PV costs could drop to 35% of today’s costs.

Offshore wind could see cost reductions of over 30%, whereas the cost reduction

potential for onshore wind seems to have been exploited already to a large extent

(Table 5.4).

In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, hydrogen is introduced as a substitute for natu-
```

ral gas, with a significant share after 2030. Hydrogen is assumed to be produced by

electrolysis. With electrolysers just emerging on larger scale on the markets, they have

considerable cost reduction potential. Based on the Plan-DelyKaD studies (Michalski

et al. [^2017]:), we assume that costs could decrease to $570/kW in the long term.

**5.3.3.2 Heating Technologies**

Assessing the costs in the heating sector is even more ambitious than in the power

sector. Costs for new installations differ significantly between regions and are inter-

linked with construction costs and industry processes, which are not addressed in

this study. Moreover, no data are available to allow the comprehensive calculation

of the costs for existing heating appliances in all regions. Therefore, we concentrate

on the additional costs resulting from new renewable applications in the heating

sector.

```
Our cost assumptions are based on a previous survey of renewable heating tech-
```

nologies in Europe, which focused on solar collectors, geothermal, heat pumps, and

biomass applications. Biomass and simple heating systems in the residential sector

are already mature. However, more-sophisticated technologies, which can provide

higher shares of heat demand from renewable sources, are still under development

and rather expensive. Market barriers will slow the further implementation and cost

reduction of renewable heating systems, especially for heating networks.

Nevertheless, significant learning rates can be expected if renewable heating is

increasingly implemented, as projected the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios.

costs in all sectors. In Europe, deep geothermal applications are being developed for

heating purposes at investment costs ranging from €500/kWth (shallow) to €3000/
kWth (deep), with the costs strongly dependent on the drilling depth. The cost reduc-
tion potential is assumed to be around 30% by 2050.

Heat pumps typically provide hot water or space heat for heating systems with

relatively low supply temperatures, or they supplement other heating technologies.

Therefore, they are currently mainly used for small-scale residential applications.

Costs currently cover a large band-width and are expected to decrease by only 20%

to $1450/kW by 2050.

For biomass and solar collectors, we assume significant differences between the

sectors. There is a broad portfolio of modern technologies for heat production from

biomass, ranging from small-scale single-room stoves to heating or CHP plants on

an MW scale. Investment costs show similar variations: simple log-wood stoves can

be obtained from $100/kW, but more sophisticated automated heating systems that

cover the whole heat demand of a building are significantly more expensive. Log-

wood or pellet boilers range from $500 to 1300/kW. Large biomass heating systems

are assumed to reach their cheapest costs in 2050 at around $480/kW for industry.

For all sectors, we assume a cost reduction of 20% by 2050. In contrast, solar col-

lectors for households are comparatively simple and will become cheap at $680/kW

by 2050. The costs of simple solar collectors for swimming pools might have been

optimized already, whereas their integration in large systems is neither technologi-

cally nor economically mature. For larger applications, especially in heat grid sys-

tems, the collectors are large and more sophisticated. Because there is not yet a mass

market for such grid-connected solar systems, we assume there will be a cost reduc-

tion potential until 2050.

**5.3.4 Fuel Cost Projections**

**5.3.4.1 Fossil Fuels**

Although fossil fuel price projections have seen considerable variations, as described
above, we based our fuel price assumptions up to 2040 on the WEO 2017 (IEA
[^2017]:). Beyond 2040, we extrapolated from the price developments between 2035
and 2040. Even though these price projections are highly speculative, they provide
a set of prices consistent to our investment assumptions. Fuel prices for nuclear
energy are based on the values in the Energy [R]evolution report 2015 (Teske et al.
[^2015]:), corrected by the cumulative inflation rate for the Eurozone of 1.82% between
2012 and 2015 (Table 5.6).

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

110

**5.3.4.2 Biomass Prices**

Biomass prices depend on the quality of the biomass (residues or energy crops) and

the regional supply and demand. The variability is large. Lamers et al. ([^2015]:) found

a price range of €4–4.8/GJ for forest residues in Europe in 2020, whereas agricul-

tural products might cost €8.5–12/GJ.  Lamers et  al. modelled a range for wood

pellets from €6/GJ in Malaysia to 8.8€/GJ in Brazil. IRENA modelled a cost supply

curve on a global level for 2030 (see Fig. 5.2), ranging from $3/GJ for a potential of

35 EJ/year. up to $8–10/GJ for a potential up to 90–100 EJ/year (IRENA [^2014]:) (and

up to $17/GJ for an potential extending to 147 EJ).

IRENA projected regional supply costs for liquid and other biomass sources in
2030 based on a global biomass use of around 108 EJ, using current primary bio-
mass prices as a proxy (see Table 5.7). Liquid biofuels demand higher prices because
of their production and transformation processes; ‘other biomass’ includes primary
biomass, such as fuel wood, energy crops, and residues.
The prices cited above hold true for modern biomass applications. Traditional
biomass use is still often based on firewood or other biomass, which is acquired
without a price (and with the labour cost not considered). No price data are yet
available for a considerable range of residues. Therefore, the average primary bio-
mass costs across the complete energy system in many regions are lower than the
available market prices for biomass commodities. Consequently, today’s market
prices represent the upper limit of today’s biomass costs.
Therefore, for our scenarios, we assumed a lower average biomass price in all
regions, starting from the lower end of the cost supply curve at around $7.50/GJ for
OECD regions, with predominantly modern applications. For Africa, Latin America,
and Asia, including Russia, which have abundant biomass residue potential, current
prices were assumed to be $3/GJ. For the remaining regions (the Middle East, and
Eastern Europe), we assumed $5/GJ.
The prices for primary biomass will increase proportionately to the IRENA ref-
erence price for ‘other biomass’ by 2030, following the increasing uptake of modern

**Fig. 5.2** Global supply curve for primary biomass in 2030 (IRENA [^2014]:)

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

112

biomass technologies and increasing trade, representing a further biomass potential
uptake along the supply curve. For the period until 2050, we consider that biomass
prices will be stable. The prices calculated by IRENA are valid for a demand of
108 EJ/year. The biomass demand considered in this study never exceeds a total of
100 EJ/year. However, the international trade in biomass may heavily influence bio-
mass prices in the future, representing a significant source of uncertainty in our
assumptions.

**5.3.5 CO**[^2]: **Costs**

The WEO 2017 (IEA [^2017]:) considers the future price of CO[^2]: in the power and
industry sectors. There is considerable variation between the current policy sce-
nario, the new policy scenario, and the 450 ppm scenario, not only in value, but also
in regional range. Various studies have indicated a close relationship between decar-
bonisation and the implicit or explicit CO[^2]: price (regardless of the most efficient
implementation measure). On the one hand, the carbon price is a precondition for a
decarbonisation of the energy sector (Lucena et  al. [^2016]:), but on the other hand,
decarbonisation may limit the costs of CO[^2]: emissions if an efficient pricing measure
is in place (Jacobson et al. [^2017]:). Because the scenarios in this study rely heavily on
effective reductions in CO[^2]: emissions, we used the CO[^2]: prices of the 450 ppm sce-
nario in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. In the reference case, we deviated from the
WEO 2017, which applies rather low CO[^2]: emission costs. Instead, we applied CO2
costs equivalent to the cost of the resulting climate damage. Based on existing stud-
ies of fossil-energy-induced damage (Anthoff and Tol [^2013]:; Stern et al. [^2006]:), we
assumed that $78/t of CO[^2]: is a plausible cost estimate in the wide range of estimates

of the social costs of CO[^2]: emissions (Table 5.8).

**5.4 Energy Scenario Narratives and Assumptions for World**
**Regions**

The scenario-building process involves many assumptions and explicit, but also
implicit, narratives about how future economies and societies, and ultimately energy
systems, may develop under the overall objective of ‘deep and rapid decarbonisa-
tion’ by 2050. These narratives depend on three main strategic pillars:

• Efficiency improvement and demand reduction: stringent implementation of
technical and structural efficiency improvements in energy demand and supply.
These will lead to a continuous reduction in both final and primary energy con-
sumption. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, these measures must be supplemented with
responsible energy consumption behaviour by the consumer.
• Deployment of renewable energies: massive implementation of new technolo-
gies for the generation of power and heat in all sectors. These will include vari-
able renewable energies from solar and wind, which have experienced
considerable cost reductions in recent years, but also more expensive technolo-
gies, such as large-scale geothermal and ocean energy, small hydro power, and
CSP.
• Sector coupling: stringent direct electrification of heating and transport technolo-
gies in order to integrate renewable energy in the most efficient way. Because
this strategy has its limitations, it will be complemented by the massive use of
hydrogen (generated by electrolysis) or other synthetic energy carriers.

Some alternative or probably complementary future technical options are explic-
itly excluded from the scenarios. In particular, those options with large uncertainties
with respect to technical, economic, societal, and environmental risks, such as large
hydro and nuclear power plants, unsustainable biomass use, carbon capture and
storage (CCS), and geoengineering, are not considered on the supply side as mitiga-
tion measures or—in the case of hydro—not expanded in the future. The sustainable
use of biomass will partly substitute for fossil fuels in all energy sectors. However,
this use will be limited to an annual global energy potential of less than 100 EJ per
year for sustainability reasons, according to the calculations of Seidenberger et al.
([^2008]:), Thrän et al. ([^2011]:), and Schueler et al. ([^2013]:).
The transformations described in the two alternative scenarios are constrained, to
a certain degree, by current short- to medium-term investment planning, as described
in the reference case, because most technical and structural options to change the
demand or supply side require years of planning and construction. This means that

both alternative scenarios start deviating significantly from the reference case only

after 2025. However, some short-term developments shown in the IEA WEO

Current Policies scenario have been corrected and are not adopted in the alternative

scenarios because there is newer statistical information (that renders the reference

development implausible). This is the case for the IEA estimates of demand devel-

opment in some regions and sectors, and it is partly true for investments in fossil-

fuel-based heat and power generation.

**5.4.1 Efficiency and Energy Intensities**

It is obvious that a major increase in energy efficiency is the backbone of each ambi-

tious transition scenario, because energy efficiency significantly reduces the need

for energy conversion and infrastructure investment. The development of the future

global energy demand is determined by three key factors:

• Population growth, which affects the number of people consuming energy or

```
using energy services. Associated with this, increasing access to energy services
in developing countries and emerging economies is an additional influencing
factor, bearing in mind that this could mean power grid access or the implemen-
tation of isolated, usually small-scale, local power systems.
```

• Economic development, which is commonly measured as GDP. In general, GDP

```
growth triggers an increase in energy demand, directly via additional industrial
activities and indirectly via an increase in private consumption arising from the
higher incomes associated with a prospering economy.
```

• Energy intensity, which is a measure of how much final energy is required in the

```
industrial sector to produce a unit of GDP. Efficiency measures help to reduce
energy intensity and can result in a decoupling of economic growth and final
energy consumption. In the ‘Residential and other’ sector, energy intensity refers
to the per capita demand for final energy (for electrical appliances and heat gen-
eration). Efficiency improvement is also a result of reduced conversion losses, in
particular those achieved by replacing thermal power generation with renewable
technologies, which leads to a further reduction in the primary energy intensity.
```

```
The reference scenario and both target scenarios are based on the same projec-
```

tions of population and economic growth. Therefore, the scenarios represent the

specific, although widely accepted, development of future societies. However, the

future development of energy intensities differs between the reference and alterna-

tive scenarios, taking into account the different efficiency pathways and therefore

the successful implementation of measures to intensify required investments in effi-

cient technologies or to change consumer behaviour.

The assumptions made about the potential to further increase the economic and

technical efficiency in all sectors are based on various external studies. However,

the lower benchmarks for the assumptions on efficiency potentials are derived from

the Current Policies scenario of the IEA WEO 2017 (IEA [^2017]:). The upper bench-

```

```

```

marks for efficiency potentials per world region are taken from Graus et al. ([^2011]:),
Kermeli et al. ([^2014]:), and recently published low-energy-demand scenarios devel-
oped by Grubler et al. ([^2018]:).

**5.4.1.1 Industrial Electricity Demand**

‘Industrial electricity demand’ refers to many appliances of different sizes and pur-
poses. Large potentials for saving electricity have been identified in various studies
in most branches of industry. This particularly applies to electric drives for com-
pressed air, pumps, and fans. The scenario model approach distinguishes between
electric appliances and power-to-heat devices for space and process heating. The
consumption of electricity per GDP varies widely between regions, depending on
their industrial structures and efficiency standards. The trajectories for industrial
electricity demands are constrained by the abovementioned lower and upper bench-
marks and aim for similar electricity uses per $GDP in the industrial sectors in all
regions by 2050. The resulting trajectories for OECD and non-OECD countries are
shown in Table 5.9. The average global electricity demand for electric appliances in
‘industry’ (without power-to-heat) will decrease from 55 kWh/$1000 GDP in 2015
to 36 kWh/$1000 in 2050 in the reference case, but to 24 kWh/$1000 in the 2.0 °C
Scenario and 23 kWh/$1000 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. However, the increased electri-
fication of industrial heat in both alternative scenarios almost cancels out the greater
efficiency increases in those two scenarios when compared with the reference case.
The average power-to-heat share in industry will increase in this period from 6% to
34% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 37% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C
Scenario, the annual electricity demand for industrial electrical appliances will be
around 5% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario between 2020 and 2025, and up to
10% lower between 2025 and 2035. However, between 2035 and 2050, the electric-
ity demand for electric appliances in the industry sector converges under the two
scenarios.

**5.4.1.2 Demand for Fuel to Produce Heat in the Industry Sector**

Industrial heat is required for different purposes and at different temperatures.

Currently, industrial (process) heat is mainly produced by burning fossil fuels.

Biomass plays a minor role, except in heat use from the combustion of residues and

biogenic waste. Some low- and medium-temperature heat is produced by co-

generation plants with combined heat and power provisions. Power-to-heat makes

up only a small percentage of the industrial energy demand for heat. Regional dif-

ferences in the nature of industry, especially in terms of the presence of energy-

intensive heavy or manufacturing industries, strongly influence the amounts of

low-, medium-, and high-temperature heat that must be produced today and in the

future (because we assume that the regional industry structure will remain the

same). Various technological improvements, process substitutions, and innovations

are technically possible and have been implemented to some extent already. An

important example is highly efficient waste heat recovery. Shorter investment cycles

and incentives to replace old technologies will help to reduce energy consumption

as quickly as possible. It is obvious that incentives are essential to trigger rapid

innovation and the implementation of new technologies. Any political strategy for

introducing such a pathway requires strong support from various industry stake-

holders and regional or even global governance to overcome the economic and tech-

nical obstacles and conflicting interests. Therefore, both alternative scenarios

assume that the conditions exist to allow rapid technological change. Table 5.10

provides the resulting final energy demands for heating per $GDP for OECD and

non-OECD countries. The average global values will decrease from 680 MJ/$1000

GDP in 2015 to 366 MJ/$1000 in 2050 in the reference case, and to 185 MJ/$1000 in

the 2.0 °C Scenario and 172 MJ/$1000 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. Compared with the

2.0 °C Scenario, the 1.5 °C Scenario assumes a significantly more rapid reduction

in the industrial heat demand. Between 2020 and 2025, the annual energy demand

for heat will be up to 8% lower under the 1.5  °C Scenario than under the 2.0  °C

Scenario, and up to 17% lower between 2025 and 2035. After 2035, the difference

will decrease again, and by 2050, it will be around 7%.

**5.4.1.3 Electricity Demand in the ‘Residential and Other’ Sector**

The electricity demand in the ‘Residential and other’ sector includes electricity use
in households, for commercial purposes, and in the service and trade sectors, fish-
ery, and agriculture. Besides lighting, information, and communication, a large
amount of electricity is used for cooking, cooling, and hot water. It has been esti-
mated that in 2015, electricity use for heating had a global average share of 5% of
the final energy use for heating. It is assumed that this share will increase signifi-
cantly to 30% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 37% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.
These increases are attributed to sector coupling, the provision of storage for vari-
able renewable energy in the heat sector, and the provision of high-temperature heat
without fuel combustion. The average global electricity use for appliances in the
‘Residential and other’ sector will decrease in the reference case from 78 kWh/$1000
GDP in 2015 to 60 kWh/$1000 in 2050, whereas it will decrease to 38 kWh/$1000 in
the 2.0  °C Scenario and to 37  kWh/$1000  in the 1.5  °C Scenario, a reduction of
more than 50% relative to today’s energy consumption. The average global electric-
ity use for appliances in the ‘Residential and other’ sector, which is related to per
capita consumption, will increase in the reference scenario from 1350 kWh/capita
in 2015 to 2370 kWh/capita in 2050, whereas it will increase to only 1490 kWh/
capita in the 2.0  °C Scenario and to 1460  kWh/capita in the 1.5  °C Scenario.
Table 5.11 shows the changes in electricity use for appliances in OECD and non-
OECD countries (without electricity for heating). Significant reduction potentials
are assumed for all world regions. Similar to the development in the industry sector,
between 2020 and 2025, the annual power demand for electrical appliances in the
‘Residential and other’ sector will be around 5% lower in the 1.5 °C Scenario than
in the 2.0  °C Scenario, and more than 10% lower between 2025 and 2035. After
2035, the two scenarios will converge again, so that in 2050, the global demand will
be only 2% higher in the 2.0 °C Scenario than in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**5.4.1.4 Fuel Demand for Heat in the ‘Residential and Other’ Sector**

The fuel demand for heat in households has quite different characteristics depend-

ing on the consumption structures in each world region and their climatic condi-

tions. In regions with harsh winters, the heat demand is dominated by the building

sector (space heat and hot water in private and commercial buildings), but in regions

with a comparatively warm climate, the demand for space heat is generally low and

heat is predominantly used for cooking and as low-temperature heat for hot water.

In the commercial sector, the energy mix for heat is more diverse. The medium- to

high-temperature process heat demand arises in this sector. Reducing the final

energy use for heating will involve reducing the demand (e.g., by improving the

thermal insulation of building envelopes) and replacing inefficient procedures and

technologies, such as the traditional use of biomass, which is still widely used for

cooking and heating in some regions. In contrast to traditional biomass, the effi-

ciency of electrical appliances can improve significantly, and they produce zero

direct emissions and no air pollution. Table 5.12 shows the assumed average final

energy demand for heating in OECD and non-OECD countries. The average global

consumption will decrease from 560 MJ/$1000 GDP in 2015 to 280 MJ/$1000 in

2050 in the reference scenario, but to 173 MJ/$1000 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to

160 MJ/$1000 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The average global per capita energy demand

for fuels in ‘Residential and other sectors’ will decrease from around 12,600 MJ/

capita per year in 2015 to 11,700 MJ/capita in the reference case. This will mainly

be due to a shift in the global population shares towards the developing regions.

Compared with the reference scenario, the energy intensity will decrease to

7300 MJ/capita in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 6700 MJ/capita in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes a significantly stronger reduction in demand than the

2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, additional efficiency measures will reduce

the final energy demand until 2025 by around 5%, and by up to 13% between 2025

and 2035 (compared with the 2.0  °C Scenario). Thereafter, the differences will

become smaller, finally reaching around 8% by 2050.

**5.4.1.5 Resulting Energy Intensities by Region**

Figure 5.3 shows the final energy intensities related to $GDP for each of the ten

world regions between 2015 and 2050 and for both alternative scenarios. The final

energy use per GDP will decrease significantly in all regions, but the decreases will

be larger (and faster) in OECD countries. This will result in smaller regional differ-

ences in the final energy demand compared with the current situation. Compared

with the very ambitious assumptions of Grubler et al. ([^2018]:) for the specific final

energy demands in northern and southern world regions, the assumptions made in

this study are conservative. In Grubler et al. ([^2018]:), the annual global final energy

use, including non-energy consumption, will decrease from 363 EJ in 2015 to 245

EJ by 2050, whereas in our study, the annual global value will decrease to 310 EJ in

the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 284 EJ in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with 586 EJ in

the reference case (see Chap. [^8]:). Because the 1.5  °C target requires a significant

reduction in emissions before 2030, the 1.5  °C Scenario necessarily reduces the

energy demand more rapidly than the 2.0  °C Scenario, but only a slightly lower

annual consumption is assumed in 2050.

**5.4.2 RES Deployment for Electricity Generation**

The power demand will increase significantly in all scenarios. In the 2.0  °C and

1.5 °C Scenarios, this will result from the continuous electrification of the heating

and transport sectors, and the increasing production of synthetic fuels for indirect

electrification and sector coupling. The available energy sources for renewable

power generation and their costs vary from region to region. Therefore, the scenar-

ios follow regionally different strategies and storylines, taking the different regional

conditions into account on the supply side. The core strategy is the replacement of

conventional thermal power and heat generators with solar, wind, geothermal, and

other renewable options for the highly efficient generation of electricity for final

energy consumption and the generation of synthetic fuels.

Our estimates of the potential for renewable power generation are based on the

results of the REMix EnDat tool developed (Scholz [^2012]:; Stetter [^2014]:; Pietzcker

et al. [^2014]:). The technical potentials for solar and wind power in each world region

were estimated while taking into account the different exclusion criteria and con-

straints documented by Stetter ([^2014]:). The analysis was used to estimate the ‘eco-

nomic’ potential for each world region, which is the upper limit of the technological

expansion under the different scenarios. ‘Economic’ potentials were derived by

assuming the minimum annual full-load hours for each technology. In the case of

PV, the assumed global economic potential was estimated to be in the order of 5.4

million TWh per year. The potential of CSP was even larger, at around 5.6 million

TWh per year. The annual wind power potentials were estimated to be in the order

of 500,000 TWh for onshore wind and around 100,000 TWh for offshore wind.

```
The harvesting of global solar radiation by PVs has enormous economic poten-
```

tial worldwide. In the last few years, economies of scale have led to a significant

cost degression for PV modules, and large PV production capacities have been cre-

ated. The PV technology also plays a major role in our scenarios because of its

decentralized characteristics, which make it easy to build cost-efficient renewable

power supplies in rural and isolated areas. However, its restriction to sunny hours

causes high daily and seasonal variability. This results in rather low annual full-load

hours. Therefore, large quantities of storage capacity must also be installed for

short-term storage to support the major expansion of PV. The storage options con-

sidered are pumped hydro storage (e.g., by the enhancement of existing hydro sites)

and a massive expansion of battery storage. This leads to uncertainties in the total

infrastructure costs for the integration of high shares of PV into the power system

and the mineral resources required for this. For this reason, the share of PV globally

remains in the range of about 30% of total power generation, with the highest shares

in the Middle East (40%), followed by OECD North America and Other Asia (35%

each). The lowest shares, in the range of 20–25%, are in Eurasia, OECD Europe,

Latin America, and China.

Wind power on land will achieve an average global generation share of 25% in

2050 in both alternative scenarios (compared with 8% in the reference case). The

highest generation shares for onshore wind are assumed in India and Eastern

Europe/Eurasia, at about 30% each. The lowest shares will be in China, the Middle

East, and Non-OECD Asia, at 18–23%. For offshore wind, the global generation

share will rise to 8% by 2050 under both alternative scenarios, compared with only

1% in the reference scenario. The highest offshore wind shares of 10–15% will be

achieved under the 2.0  °C Scenario in the OECD regions and Eastern Europe/

Eurasia. The lowest shares are predicted in the Middle East (2%), India (6%), and

China (6.5%), where the potential is rather limited. The offshore shares under the

```
T. Pregger et al.
```

```
121
```

1.5 °C Scenario will tend to be slightly lower because of the stronger focus on PV

and onshore wind as the best options for a very rapid expansion of RES.

Compared with PV and wind power, CSP plants promise highly flexible power

and heat generation, with high capacity factors due to high-temperature heat stor-

age. The use of heat for desalination can also contribute to secure water supplies in

the sunbelt of the world. We assume that its multi-purpose uses and dispatchable

generation capability can lead to a significant role for CSP in the medium- to long-

term future, although levelized costs of CSP are today still much higher than they

are for PV or wind, and investment costs for batteries for short-term electricity stor-

age might also decrease in the future. Therefore, it is assumed that CSP will achieve

an average global electricity generation share of 15% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario

and 13% in the 1.5 °C Scenario, compared with 0.5% in the reference case. A high

share, close to 30%, will be achieved, especially in the Middle East. This will

include electricity generation for export to OECD Europe of up to 120 TWh per

year by 2050. High CSP potentials are also assumed for Africa (16%), which will

also export up to 280 TWh/year in 2050 from North Africa to OECD Europe—and

for China (18–20%) and Non-OECD Asia (15–17%).

```
Hydro power generation will increase only moderately under the alternative sce-
```

narios compared with the reference case. This source has already been tapped and

large hydro plants usually have significant ecological and societal consequences.

Therefore, the average global power generation share will decrease in the alterna-

tive scenarios from today’s 16% to around 8%, whereas the reference scenario

assumes a generation share of 14% in 2050. Nevertheless, a 30% increase in the

global hydro power generation is assumed between 2015 and 2050. The highest

power generation shares in 2050 are assumed to be in Latin America (24%), fol-

lowed by OECD Europe (11%) and China (10%). The generation of hydro power

plays only a minor role in the long term in the Middle East (1%), Africa, and India

(each 4%).

Even smaller contributions are assumed for geothermal energy, ocean energy,

and biomass. All three options have comparably high power-generation costs, but

offer complementary characteristics and availabilities that may stabilize future elec-

tricity supply systems. The global average share of geothermal power generation is

assumed to be about 5% in 2050, ocean energy use will contribute another 2%, and

biomass, including co-generation, will achieve a maximum of 6–7% around 2030

and 5% in 2050. The highest share for geothermal power generation is assumed to

occur in Eastern Europe/Eurasia (11%), for ocean energy in OECD Pacific (4%),

and for biomass use in Latin America, Eastern Europe/Eurasia, and OECD Europe

(8–9%). It is predicted that hydrogen will take an increasing share of the remaining

thermal power generation, as a substitute for natural gas in gas turbines and com-

bined cycle gas turbine plants and with increasing contributions from hydrogen fuel

cells to co-generation. Figure 5.4 shows the basic storyline in global power genera-

tion under the 2.0 °C Scenario.

**5.4.3 RES Deployment for Heat Generation**

Heat generation covers a broad range of processes, including district heat (either

from co-generation or public heating plants), direct heating in buildings, and pro-

cess heat in industry, commerce, and other sectors. Different technologies are con-

sidered for each sector, and strong RES expansion is assumed. The increasing heat

extraction from co-generation will trigger increasing district heat use, which will

stabilizes in the long term or decrease by 2050 with the declining heat demand

attributable to ambitious efficiency measures. However, CHP will only contribute

significantly in regions with a tradition of district heating and/or a high heat demand

in the building sector. No strong expansion of heat grids is assumed in regions with-

out existing heat grids and a low demand for space heat.

```
Electricity for heating is assumed to play a significant role in future energy sys-
```

tems. In contrast to today’s technology, flexible use is assumed, adjusted to variable

feed-ins from variable renewable generation. This implies the availability of heat

storages, smart operation controls, and flexible electricity tariffs. Electricity can be

used with relatively low investment for space heating and is therefore easily com-

bined with other heating technologies. For example, simple electric heaters can eas-

ily be integrated into heat storage or heating grids. However, more-efficient electric

heat pumps generally require higher investment in both the heat pump itself and in

the heat distribution within the building. Electricity can also be used to provide

process heat in industry at high-temperature levels. The alternative scenarios glob-

ally assume a significant increase in the average electricity share of the final energy

for heating in ‘Industry’ from 6% in 2015 to around 34% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and

37% in the 1.5 °C Scenario by 2050. All regions achieve shares of between 23% and

43%. Electricity shares in the ‘Residential and other’ sector are assumed to grow

from 5% in 2015 to 30% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 35% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

```
However, the need for process heat at high temperature levels, problems associ-
```

ated with process integration, and specific process requirements call for additional

process-specific strategies for replacing fossil fuels in the industry sector. As men-

tioned above, electrification is a comparatively efficient strategy. Other strategies

are the use of biomass and hydrogen or—with some limitations—concentrated solar

energy. While hydrogen is used to provide high temperature process heat in this

study, it could—at least partially—be replaced by other synthetic energy carriers,

such as synthetic methane, which can be generated from hydrogen and a (renew-

able) carbon source. This power-to-gas option has the advantage that it can be fed in

into the gas grid, and act in storage and transport. However, energy losses are around

20% higher (compared with hydrogen). As a consequence, synthetic methane is not

taken into account in the scenarios.

```
Overall, biomass use for heating in the ‘Residential and other’ sector is decreas-
```

ing as the traditional and currently inefficient use of biomass is replaced by advanced

efficient technologies, and biomass is used in a more efficient way in the energy

system. Thus, the average global share of biomass as a final energy source for heat-

ing will decrease from today’s 34% to 22% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to

17% in the 1.5 °C Scenario, when direct electrification and indirect electrification

(via synthetic gases and fuels) play a stronger role. In contrast, biomass use in the

‘Industry’ sector will increase continuously as the combustion of biomass can be

used to generate high-temperature heat for many industrial processes for which

renewable low-temperature heat sources are unsuitable. The average global share of

biomass for the final energy for heating in the ‘Industry’ sector will increase from

9% in 2015 to 19% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 14% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

The largest shares are assumed for Latin America (47%) and Africa (35%) in the

2.0 °C Scenario, where biomass residues are still rather abundant, with much lower

values for the 1.5 °C Scenario (18–21%). In that scenario, biomass as a transition

technology will be avoided due to the earlier development of alternative renewable

technologies and electrification. The lowest shares are assumed for the Middle East

(4%) and China (7%) in both alternative scenarios because of their limited sustain-

able potentials.

Solar collectors are suitable for hot water preparation and for supporting heating

systems using heat storage. In heat grids, large heat storage systems can also be used

to balance the seasonal heat demand and solar generation, and the integration of

solar heat at low costs in the long term. The contributions of solar collectors to the

heat supply are limited by the temperatures that collectors can provide (below

120 °C for traditional collectors and up to 300 °C for concentrated collectors) and

the seasonal variations in regions with significant space heat demand. In the alterna-

tive scenarios, the global average share of solar thermal final energy for heating will

rise to 19% in the ‘Residential and other’ sector. The largest shares are assumed to

be in the Middle East (30–25%), where the abundance of solar radiation can be

exploited by concentrated solar heat applications. All other regions have shares

between 15% and 22%, considering the limited applicability of concentrated sys-

tems. The global average solar share in the ‘Industry’ sector will increase to 16% by

2050. The largest shares are achieved in the Middle East (25%) and Africa (20%)

[^5]: Main Assumptions for Energy Pathways

124

and the lowest shares are assumed in Eastern Europe/Eurasia (9%), followed by the
OECD regions (10–13%).
Heat pumps allow very efficient heat supply. System-wide CO[^2]: emissions depend

on the CO[^2]: emissions in the power mix. Because of their generation of low-
temperature heat, heat pumps play a role in space heating in regions with moderate

or cold climates, but large industrial heat pumps can also generate low-temperature
heat for industrial processes and tap the enormous potential of waste heat. A con-
tinuous improvement in the coefficient of performance of heat pumps, which
describes the ratio of useful energy in the form of heat to the required compressor
energy in the form of electricity, in all existing plants from an average of 3 today to
a value of 4 in 2050 is assumed. The application potential of heat pumps (in terms
of MWth) is assumed to be limited by the low temperature of the heat provided, the
increasing share of the grid-connected heat supply, the assumed increase in exten-
sive building insulation, and the low space heating demand in some world regions.
In addition to heat pumps, an increase in deep geothermal energy use is assumed for
the ‘Industry’ sector, with an increase of up to 11% in the global average share of
final energy by 2050 under both alternative scenarios.
Hydrogen use for direct heating is linked to the increasing substitution of natural
gas with hydrogen in all sectors, except transport. This will lead to a hydrogen share
of 12–14% in final energy for heating in the ‘Industry’ sector under the two alterna-
tive scenarios and 3% in the ‘Residential and other’ sector under the 2.0 °C Scenario
and 4% under the 1.5 °C Scenario. The highest hydrogen shares in ‘Industry’ are
assumed for OECD North America (22–23%), followed by other OECD regions,
Eastern Europe/Eurasia, China, and the Middle East with shares of 13%–18%. The
lowest shares, below 5%, are assumed for Latin America and Africa, where biomass
from residues provides a flexible alternative. The highest hydrogen shares in the
‘Residential and other’ sector will be in the Middle East (7–10%), followed by
OECD Pacific (6–8%) and OECD Europe (up to 9%) (Figs. 5.5 and 5.6).

**5.4.4 Co-generation of Heat and Power and District Heating**

Compared with condensing power plants with high efficiency losses due to waste

heat, the co-generation of heat and power (combined heat and power, CHP) allows

the highly efficient use of fossil and renewable fuels. If this approach is made more

flexible with the help of heat storage, and if it is powered by renewable fuels, such

as biomass or hydrogen from renewable electricity, CHP promises to generate not

only renewable power in a flexible way but also to integrate efficiently large shares

of renewable heat into energy systems via large and small district heating systems.

Therefore, co-generation is a particularly good option in regions with high low- to

medium-temperature heat demands (e.g., industrial consumers and space heating).

Our modelling distinguishes between public generation in large CHP plants and

CHP autoproduction. The latter comprises industrial CHP generators but also

smaller plants in the ‘Residential and other’ sector. Power-to-heat ratios, efficien-

cies, and assumed costs reflect these different structural options. The IEA Energy

Balances provides statistical values with which to calibrate the co-generation for

each world region. The scenarios then assume the similar development of these

parameters according to a defined advanced state of technology, with overall effi-

ciencies of 85–90%.

Although absolute electricity generation from CHP will increase in all regions,

all scenarios assume a decreasing power generation share for CHP in the long term

due to the decommissioning of fossil-fuel generators, the limited availability of bio-
mass, and the assumption that heat losses in CHP technologies will be reduced,
leading to higher overall efficiency. Tables 5.13 and 5.14 show the resulting devel-
opments for power and heat as intensities summed across the ‘Industry’ and
‘Residential and other’ sectors. Whereas the absolute power supply from CHP will
increase in all regions, the power-related intensities will decrease. Under the 2.0 °C
Scenario, higher CHP power production is assumed to be higher than in the refer-
ence case, as a balancing option for variable renewable sources. CHP plants will
play a smaller role in the future, particularly in non-OECD countries.
For heat, the situations are more diverse between the scenarios and regions.
While the intensity of heat use from CHP will increase in the OECD regions, it will
decrease in the non-OECD regions. Even though the intensity converges between
OECD and non-OECD regions under all scenarios, the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios
will achieve higher levels of intensity. However, the early reduction in demand in
the 1.5 °C Scenario will preclude any additional demand for CHP.

**5.4.5 Other Assumptions for Stationary Processes**

Although the energy losses in the production of synthetic fuels are significant, these
fuels are expected to be mandatory in the deep decarbonisation scenarios for sectors
and processes in which the direct use of other renewable sources, including renew-
able power, is not technically feasible. We assume an optimistic increase in the
efficiency[^1] of electrolytic hydrogen generation, from 66% today to 77% by 2050
(ratio of energy output [H[^2]:] to energy input [electricity]). The generation of syn-
thetic fuels (such as Fischer-Tropsch fuels) from hydrogen, using CO[^2]: as the carbon
source, is assumed to be a complementary option that will allow the decarbonisation

of long-range transport, particularly aviation and international bunkers, without

exceeding the defined maximum sustainable biomass use. Therefore, the assumed

shares of power-to-liquid synfuels in the aggregated biofuel/synfuel fraction of all

transport modes (according to Sect. 6.3.3.) is a result of the sectoral allocation of the

limited biomass potentials in each world region. The assumed efficiency[^2] of synfuel

generation will increase from 35% in 2020 to 42% in 2050. As well as in fuel-cell
vehicles, hydrogen can be used to replace natural gas in stationary processes by
2030  in both scenarios, mostly for use in industry and co-generation plants. The
scenarios do not assume a hydrogen economy in the long term. The development of
hydrogen infrastructure is expected to be inefficient, especially for residential use.
However, because hydrogen is assumed to be fed into the gas grid with a share of up
to 100% by 2050, it will also be partly used in the ‘Residential and other’ sector,
which includes various commercial applications.
The allocation of the limited biomass to the power, heat, and transport sectors
differs significantly between the available scenarios. In this study, the biomass in the
alternative scenarios is mainly for use in transport, co-generation, and industry.
Traditional biomass use is strongly reduced, but biomass remains an important pil-
lar of heat supply in the ‘Residential and other’ sector under the assumption that the
most-efficient technologies are implemented. Biofuel production for transportation
remains limited. An increase in overall efficiency of up to 75% is assumed, implying
the use of residues for heat and power generation.
The efficiency of fossil technologies will also increase, especially for gas power
plants. This goes along with the decreasing utilization rates that result from the vari-
able feed-in from renewable energies. Therefore, the scenarios implicitly assume
that the future innovations in all combustion technologies will focus on maximum
efficiency at lower utilization rates. Gas power plants will be used for backup,
requiring low investment but providing high flexibility to the power system.
Therefore, a part of the energy transition is the rapid replacement of inflexible
medium- to base-load power plant capacities with flexible gas power plants.

#### Transport Transition Concepts

**Johannes Pagenkopf, Bent van den Adel, Özcan Deniz, and Stephan Schmid**

**Abstract** Detailed background for all transport scenarios and development path-

ways including all key parameters, and story-lines for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C

transport scenario pathways. Mode specific efficiency improvement over time for

road-, rail- and aviation transport technologies. Explanations of all vehicle tech-

nologies are included in the scenarios, along with the rationale for their selection.

Description of key technology parameters for all relevant transport modes such as

energy demand per passenger, and per freight tonne. Detailed regional breakdown

for developments in regard to transport energy demand for ten world regions and all

transport modes are provided.

**6.1 Introduction**

Global transport accounted for 23% of total anthropogenic CO[^2]: emissions in 2010
and those emissions have increased at a rapid rate in recent decades, reaching 7 Gt

in 2010 according to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Sims et  al. [^2014]:). The
reason for this steady increase in emissions is that passenger and freight transport
activities are increasing in all world regions, and there is currently no sign that this
growth will slow down in the near future. The increasing energy demand in the
transport sector has mainly been met by greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting fossil
fuels. Although (battery) electric mobility has recently surged considerably, it has
done so from a very low base, which is why, in terms of total numbers, electricity
still plays a relatively minor role as an energy carrier in the transport sector.
Apart from their impacts on climate, increasing transport levels, especially of
cars, trucks, and aeroplanes, also have unwanted side-effects, including accidents,
traffic jams, the emission of noise and other pollutants, visual pollution, and the
disruption of landscapes by the large-scale build-up of the transport infrastructure.

However, road, rail, sea, and air transport are also an integral part of our globalized
and interconnected world, and guarantee prosperity and inter-cultural exchange.
Therefore, if we are to cater to people’s desire for mobility while keeping the econ-
omy running and meeting the Paris climate goals, fundamental technical, opera-
tional, and behavioural measures are required immediately.
In this transport chapter, we discuss potential transport activity pathways and
technological developments by which the requirement that warming does not exceed
pre-industrial levels by more than 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C can be met—while at the same
time maintaining a reasonable standard of mobility.
For our transport scenario modelling, the global warming limits of 2.0  °C and
1.5  °C were translated into transport CO[^2]: budgets. We structured our scenario
designs around the following key CO[^2]:-reducing measures[^1]:

• Powertrain electrification;
• Enhancement of energy efficiency through technological development;
• Use of bio-based and synthetically produced fuels;
• Modal shifts (from high- to low-energy intensity modes) and overall reductions

in transport activity in energy-intensive transport modes.

These measures are outlined in more detail in the subsequent chapters.

**6.2 Global Transport Picture in 2015**

The world final energy demand in the transport sector totalled 94,812 PJ[^2] in 2015,
according to the IEA Energy Balances (IEA 2017a, b, c). Based on this estimate, we
used TRAEM (Sect. 3.3 to model the freight and passenger transport performance
in our transport model with statistical data and energy efficiency figures.
The following paragraphs outline the 2015 transport structure modelled in
TRAEM, which is the starting point for the subsequent scenario building until 2050.
As can be seen from Fig. 6.1, road passenger transport had the biggest transport
final energy share of 51% in 2015. Most of this comprised individual road passenger
modes (mostly cars, but also two- and three-wheel vehicles), which accounted for
45% of all end energy in the transport sector. In total, road transport (passenger and
freight) accounted for around 90% of total final energy demand for transport.
The majority of total passenger–km (pkm) in passenger transport (around 85%
of total pkm) is contributed by road transport modes. Freight is much more rail-
oriented, and has a 42% share of total tonne–km (tkm), as shown in Fig. 6.2. The
tkm share is much larger than the energy share arising from the much higher energy
efficiency of railways compared with trucks.
Figure 6.3 shows the powertrain split of all transport modes in 2015 (by pkm or
tkm respectively). With a few exceptions, the majority of modes were still heavily
dependent on conventional internal combustion engines (ICE). A small number of
buses had electric powertrains, which were mainly trolleybuses and increasingly

also battery-powered electric buses, predominantly in China. China also has a par-

ticularly large number of electric two- and three-wheel vehicles. Almost all battery

electric scooters worldwide were in China. Passenger rail was electrified to a large

extent (e.g., metro and high-speed trains), whereas freight trains were predomi-

nantly not electrified.

OECD America and OECD Europe together make up nearly half the total energy

demand (Fig. 6.4), and China is almost on the same level as OECD Europe, although

it has about twice as many inhabitants as OECD Europe.

**6.3 Measures to Reduce and Decarbonise Transport Energy**
**Consumption**

This section describes the measures required to reduce the final energy demand and
decarbonise the transport sector. A variety of actions will be required so that the
transport sector can conform to the <2.0 °C or 1.5 °C global warming pathways. The

set of actions described can be clustered into technical and operational measures

(e.g., energy efficiency increases, drivetrain electrification); behavioural measures

(e.g., shifts to less-carbon-intensive transport carriers and an overall reduction in

transport activity); and accompanying policy measures (e.g., taxation, regulations,

urban planning, and the promotion of less-harmful transport modes). This study

focuses on the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios and sets out the differences between

these scenarios and the business-as-usual 5.0 °C Scenario.

and aviation) in OECD countries seem nearly unavoidable until the electrification

(based on renewable energy production) of the transport sector undergoes a

breakthrough.

**6.3.1 Powertrain Electrification**

Increasing the market penetration of highly efficient (battery and fuel-cell) electric

vehicles, coupled with clean electricity generation, is a powerful lever and probably

also the most effective means of moving toward a decarbonised transport system.

All electric vehicles have the highest efficiency levels of all the drivetrain options.

Today, only a few countries have significant proportions of electric vehicles in their

fleets. The total numbers of electric vehicles, particularly in road transport, are

insignificant, but because road transport is by far the largest CO[^2]: emitter in overall
transport, it offers a very powerful lever for decarbonisation. In terms of drivetrain

electrification, we cluster the world regions into three groups, according to the dif-
fusion theory (Rogers [^2003]:):

• _Innovators_: OECD North America (excluding Mexico), OECD Europe, OECD
Pacific, and China
• _Moderate_: Mexico, Non-OECD Asia, India, Eurasia, and Latin America
• _Late adopters_: Africa and the Middle East.

Although this clustering is rough, it sufficiently mirrors the basic tendencies we
modelled. The regions differ in the speed with which novel technologies, especially
electric drivetrains, will penetrate the market.

**6.3.1.1 The 5.0 °C Scenario**

The 5.0 °C Scenario follows the IEA Current Policies Scenario (IEA 2017a) until
2040, with extrapolation to 2050. We model only minor electrification over all
transport modes (see Fig. 6.5), with passenger cars and buses making relevant gains
in _electric vehicle_ (EV) shares. For example, we project a share of 30% for _battery_
_electric vehicles_ (BEV) in China by 2050 due to foreseeable legislation and techno-
logical advancements in that country (Cui and Xiao [^2018]:), whereas for the world
car fleet, the share is projected to increase to only around 10%. The growth in the
share of the commercial road vehicle fleet and of the fleet of two- and three-wheel
vehicles held of electric powertrains will be small, as will be the increase in further
rail electrification. Aviation and navigation (shipping) will remain fully dependent
on conventional kerosene and diesel, respectively.

**6.3.1.2 The 2.0 °C Scenario**

Based on the low market share of BEV observed today (2018), minimal progress in

electrification until 2020 is assumed in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Moving towards 2030,

the _innovator_ regions will experience strong electrification, encouraged by purchase

incentives, EV credit systems, and tightened CO[^2]: fleet emission targets. Passenger
cars and light commercial vehicles are projected to achieve shares of BEVs in the

regional stocks between 21% and 30%, whereas heavy commercial vehicles and
buses will attain even higher EV fleet shares of between 28% and 52% by 2030.
This will require a massive build-up of battery production capacity in the coming
years. Electric city buses and some trolley trucks will make a significant contribu-
tion to this development. Two- and three-wheel vehicles will be nearly completely
electrified (batteries and fuel cells) in a couple of regions. OECD Pacific will head
the _fuel-cell-electric vehicle_ (FCEV) market introduction, which will account for up
to 6% of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2030, with Japan and
South Korea the main market drivers. Higher shares of FCEV in _innovator_ regions
are more likely in the bus and heavy truck sector, which reach up to 10% in 2030.
In 2050 in the innovative regions, only a minor proportion of vehicles will have ICE
(up to 9%). Passenger cars and light commercial vehicles will predominantly be
electrified, with a BEV share of around 80%. FCEV will also gain a significant
share of 17% in OECD Pacific and OECD North America.

```

```
Looking ahead to 2050, 60–70% of buses and heavy trucks will probably be (bat-
```

tery) electric, whereas FCEV will increase their market share to around 37%. The

proportion of buses and heavy trucks that will be BEV in 2050 will be around

60–70%. Two- and three-wheel vehicles will be nearly fully electrified in all regions

(80–100%).

```
In the moderate regions, the BEV share of road transport vehicles is set in a
```

range of 1–15%. Except for Latin America, the _moderate_ regions will have an ICE

share of 83% or less for passenger cars. For example, India is progressing with its

current electrification strategy and up to 14% of its passenger cars will be battery-

powered by 2030. It is likely that ICE will dominate buses and trucks in the _moder-_

_ate_ regions in 2030. Fuel-cell cars now have small shares of 1–2%. Non-OECD Asia

is positively influenced by its _innovator_ neighbour region, OECD Pacific. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, _moderate_ regions will reach BEV shares of up to 67% for passen-

ger cars and light commercial vehicles and between 54% and 65% for buses and

heavy trucks by 2050. Compared with the _innovator_ regions, the _moderate_ regions

will not experience a significant uptake of FCEVs. Africa and the Middle East will

remain mostly dependent on ICE in 2050, with shares of around 90%. Only slow

electrification will occur in Africa, with small and cheap BEVs (Fig. 6.6).

As an example of how different the electrification speeds will be across the world

regions, Fig. 6.7 shows the uptake of electric and fuel-cell drivetrains in buses and

two- and three-wheel vehicles, region by region, in terms of pkm. In 2015, a sub-

stantial proportion (15%) of China’s buses were already electrified. OECD Pacific

and OECD Europe will follow, with substantial electrification after 2020, as will

India, Non-OECD Asia, and Eurasia after 2030. The remaining regions will elec-

trify their fleets predominantly after 2035. Fuel-cell drivetrains will not begin to

penetrate the market to a significant extent until 2025. We project a fleet that is

40–70% electric (battery and trolley) and 10–30% fuel-cell electric by 2050 in the

2.0 °C Scenario.

```
Figure 6.8 plots the projected electrification of passenger and freight rail in terms

Europe, OECD Pacific, and China in 2015, and substantial electric freight transport

in OECD Europe and Eurasia. In most other world regions, freight transport by rail

predominantly relied on diesel locomotives.

In most world regions, nearly all rail traffic is projected to be electric after
2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Total diesel consumption in rail operations is projected
to increase slowly until 2030, mainly because railway vehicles have long lifespans,
and once diesel cars are put into operation, they are not replaced overnight.
Furthermore, line electrification usually requires several years of planning and
construction.
Aviation will probably remain predominantly powered by liquid fossil fuels (ker-
osene and bio- and synfuel derivatives) in the medium to long term because of limi-
tations in electrical energy storage. We project a moderate increase in domestic pkm
flown in electric aircrafts starting in 2030, with larger shares in OECD Europe
because the flight distances are shorter than, for example, in the USA (Fig. 6.9).
Norway has announced plans to perform all short-haul flights electrically by 2040
(Agence France-Presse [^2018]:).
However, no real electrification breakthrough in aviation is foreseeable unless
the attainable energy densities of batteries increase to 800–1000  Wh/kg, which
would require fast-charging capable post-lithium battery chemistries.

**6.3.1.3 The 1.5 °C Scenario**

In the 1.5  °C Scenario, an earlier and more rapid ramp-up of electric powertrain

penetration is required than in the 2.0 °C Scenario and the _innovative_ regions will

be at the forefront. The _moderate_ regions will also need to electrify more rapidly

than in the 2.0 °C Scenario, but will end up with only a minimally higher share by

2050. In the passenger car sector in particular, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles

(PHEVs) will ensure a sharp reduction in conventional combustion engine vehicles

between 2030 and 2050. In the _late adopter_ regions, there is no difference between

the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios. The phasing out of internal combustion engine

(ICE) vehicles will occur more quickly under the 1.5  °C Scenario than under the

2.0 °C Scenario (Fig. 6.10).

**6.3.2 Mode-Specific Efficiency and Improvements Over Time**

In passenger transport, trains and buses are much more energy efficient per pkm

than passenger cars or aeroplanes. This situation does not change fundamentally if

only electric drivetrains are compared (Fig. 6.11). It is apparent that railways and

especially ships are clearly more energy efficient than trucks in transporting freight

(Fig. 6.12). The 2015 figures are the starting point for a more detailed discussion,

mode by mode, later in this chapter, and these figures are the basis for the rationale

of our discussion in terms of modal shift (Chap. [^6]:, Sect. 4 ). The efficiency data are

based on literature-reported and transport operator information. The efficiency lev-
els in terms of pkm or tkm depend to a large extent on the underlying capacity uti-
lization of the vehicles, which differs between world regions. The numbers are
average values and differences are evaluated at the regional level.
In addition to powertrain electrification, there are other potential improvements
in energy efficiency, and their implementation will steadily improve energy intensity
over time. Regardless of the types of powertrains and fuels used, efficiency improve-
ments on the MJ/pkm or MJ/tkm level will result from (for example):

• Reductions in powertrain losses through more-efficient motors, gears, power
electronics, etc.;
• Reductions in aerodynamic drag;

• Reductions in vehicle mass through light-weighting;
• The use of smaller vehicles;
• Operational improvements (e.g., through automatic train operation, load factor

improvements).

The measures are discussed in the following mode-specific sub-chapters.

**6.3.3 Road Transport**

**6.3.3.1 Passenger Cars**

As of 2017, 99% of the passenger cars produced worldwide were estimated to be

equipped with an ICE: the majority of them gasoline or diesel (95%), 3.4% hybrid

electric vehicles (HEV), and 0.7% PHEV (BCG [^2017]:). Only about 0.9% of the cars

sold were pure battery electric vehicles (BEV). There are several options for energy

efficiency improvements. The fuel consumption reduction potential of petrol

engines as a result of engine improvements and hybridization is around 25–30%,

and it is around 15–20% for diesel engines (van Basshuysen and Schäfer [^2015]:).

Maximum efficiencies of 38–40% can be reached by ICE (Schäfer [^2016]:), whereas

electric drivetrains have efficiencies of 80–85% (including [re]charging losses).

Besides the reduction in engine losses, both lightweight construction and reductions

in rolling resistance will result in additional fuel savings.

Hybrid systems increase the complexity of powertrains, resulting in higher

masses and higher costs, but they offer additional fuel-saving potentials. Energy can

thus be recovered by recuperation during braking in hybridized and all-electric

vehicles. In BEV and FCEV, advanced battery technologies can reduce the overall
vehicle mass. However, post-lithium technologies, such as lithium–sulfur and solid-
state batteries with increased energy densities and lower systems masses compared
with today’s Li-ion battery technologies, will probably not enter the transport sector
before 2030 (Schmuch et al. [^2018]:).
In total, we project a 1% increase in annual efficiency on a per passenger/km
basis (the same for all drivetrains) for the 5.0  °C and 2.0  °C Scenarios. The effi-
ciency improvements for 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario will be achieved in 2040 under
the 1.5 °C Scenario (Fig. 6.13).

**6.3.3.2 Light and Heavy Freight Vehicles**

Like passenger cars, trucks are currently driven almost exclusively by conventional
ICE. With a market share of 84% of diesel-fuelled vehicles in 2015 (IEA 2017c),
the global fleet of trucks was predominantly operating on diesel (IEA 2017b). In
some regions, such as the Middle East, trucks are also powered by gasoline to a
considerable degree. Electric drivetrains will enter the truck sector gradually in
coming years because of changes in exhaust emissions legislation and because the
higher efficiency of electric drivetrains compared with ICE will offer economic
advantages to road carriers (Fig. 6.14). Compared with diesel-powered trucks, fuel-
cell electric drivetrains in trucks can substantially reduce the energy intensity per
tkm, and allow higher operating ranges than battery-powered trucks. To achieve
rapid improvements in energy efficiency in the truck sector, the hybridization of
diesel powertrains, especially those operating in stop-and-go intensive urban envi-
ronments, is promising (Burke and Hengbing [^2017]:; Lischke [^2017]:). However, after
2030, the hybrid diesel powertrain will be seen merely as a transitional technology
before the advent of fully electric powertrains (overhead catenary, battery electric,
and fuel-cell electric). Therefore, the development of battery recharging and hydro-
gen refuelling infrastructures will require massive investments in coming years. In

the commercial sector, it is likely that many electrical charging stations will be set

up on the private grounds of logistics operators. The market growth of BEV in the

truck sector will require considerable public spending on the installation of over-

head catenary lines along major highways for trolley trucks (hybridized with diesel,

fuel cells, or batteries). The first pilot lanes are being developed in Germany,

Sweden, and California (USA) (Siemens [^2017]:).

**6.3.3.3 Buses**

State-of-the-art city buses operate on ICE (diesel or gas) or are trolley buses (all-

electric or hybridized with an additional battery or diesel motor). Diesel hybrids

have entered the city bus market and constitute a large proportion of the bus fleets

in a range of cities today. The short distances between stations, small operating

radii, and moderate daily mileages make the use of batteries in city buses a viable

option, complemented by fuel cells for routes with higher ranges or difficult ter-

rains. Battery electric buses are between the prototype/experimental stage and a

mature technology. In China, battery electric buses are already an integral part of

public bus transport systems, and the city of Shenzen has had a 100% electric bus

fleet since 2016 (over 16,000 battery electric buses) (Sisson [^2018]:). Fuel-cell electric

buses still lag behind battery electric buses in terms of numbers, but are increasing.

In 2017, about 80 fuel-cell electric buses were in operation in Europe (Element

Energy Ltd. [^2018]:) and 26 in the USA (Eudy and Post [^2017]:). Full battery operation

is more difficult to achieve in regional and long-distance buses and coaches, so the

uptake of full battery electric and also fuel-cell powertrains will be slower than in

city buses. Diesel-powered buses will remain in the market longer, complemented

by diesel hybrid powertrains. Ultimately, fuel-cell-powered inter-urban coaches

will probably be more common than fuel-cell-powered city buses. In our model, we

divided the regions into _innovators_ (i.e., China and OECD countries) and all the

other regions lagging behind the innovators. We also identified a clear trend towards

electrification.

We project a 0.5% (diesel, diesel-hybrid and natural gas) to 0.8% (electric and

fuel cell hydrogen electric) increase in efficiency on a per passenger per km basis in

all three scenarios (Fig. 6.15).

**6.3.3.4 Two- and Three-Wheel Vehicles**

Two-wheel vehicles are probably the most important component of everyday traffic

in large parts of Asia and Africa. The drivetrain efficiencies of e-scooters are

reported to be 1.2–3 kWh/100 vehicle–km. China is by far the biggest market for

electric scooters in the world, with more than 200 million electric scooters on the

road by 2015, that translates to an electric share of about 70%.

Three-wheel vehicles (also country-specifically called ‘rickshaws’ or ‘tuk-tuks’)

have at least two, and usually three or more seats, and are often overloaded in daily

traffic. India alone is reported to have 2.5 million rickshaws on the road, each travel-

ling 70–150  km/day (Abu Mallouh et  al. [^2010]:). Most three-wheel vehicles are

fuelled by gasoline and some by liquid petroleum gas (LPG), although some com-

munities incentivize the conversion of two-stroke engines to battery electric three-

wheel vehicles. Electric tuk-tuks are increasingly emerging in South-East Asia,

together with battery swap stations and solar-powered rickshaws (Moran [^2018]:;

Reddy et al. [^2017]:). Thailand has announced that it plans to convert all existing two-

stroke-powered tuk-tuks to battery electric powertrains within 5  years (Coconuts

Bangkok [^2017]:). In India, too, plans are repeatedly announced to electrify all new

two- and three-wheel vehicles within the next two decades (Ghoshal [^2017]:).

```
The efficiency of battery electric drivetrains is much better than that of conven-
```

tional two-stroke engines in two- and three-wheel vehicles (Fig. 6.16). We project a

0.5% annual increase in efficiency on a per pkm basis (the same for all drivetrains)

in all three scenarios.

**6.3.3.5 Rail Transport**

No other transport mode is more suited to operate electrically than railways. Urban

rail systems, for instance, are invariably electric. Electric trains consume about

60–70% less energy than diesel trains when their final energy use is compared (on

catenary and tank levels, respectively). According to the International Railway

Association, about 32% of the worldwide rail network was electrified in 2015 (UIC

[^2017]:). However, in terms of transport performance (pkm or tkm), the ratio of elec-

tric to diesel is higher because electrified rail lines usually experience more traffic

than non-electrified lines. The electrification of rail lines with overhead catenaries

has been the state-of-the-art technology for decades and new lines are almost exclu-

sively equipped with overhead power lines right from the start.

However, line electrification, especially of existing lines, is often difficult to

achieve due to unsettled and complex right-of-way issues, narrow tunnel diameters,

or simply because line electrification is not economically viable due to low line

utilization. The use of on-board batteries for mixed electrified/non-electrified lines

and shunting operations and the use of fuel-cell hybrid powertrains for longer lines

with little or no electrification whatsoever could be feasible fully electric alterna-

tives to diesel power or full-line electrification. (Fuel-cell electric trains have not

been modelled in this research).

We project a 0.5% annual increase in efficiency on a per passenger per km basis
and a 0.8% annual increase in efficiency on a per tonne per km basis (the same for
all drivetrains) in all three scenarios (Fig. 6.17).
The actual efficiency depends on the type of train and the world region. These
differences are considered in every transport sub-model and are exemplified in
Fig. 6.18 for freight and passenger trains.

**6.3.3.6 Water and Air Transport**

Inland navigation will probably remain predominantly powered by ICE in the next
few decades. Therefore, we did not model the electrification of inland navigation
vessels. However, pilot projects using diesel hybrids, batteries, and fuel cells are in
preparation (DNV GL [^2015]:). We assumed the same increase in the share of bio- and
synthetic fuels over time as in the road and rail sectors.
In aviation, energy efficiency can be improved by measures such as winglets,
advanced composite-based lightweight structures, powertrain hybridization, and
enhanced air traffic management systems (Madavan [^2016]:; Vyas et  al. [^2013]:). We

project a 1% annual increase in efficiency on a per pkm basis.

**6.3.4 Replacement of Fossil Fuels by Biofuels and Synfuels**

The use of biofuels in the transport sector offers a potential lever to reduce the CO2
emissions from fossil fuels. Biofuels can be used either as a direct drop-in or as

admixtures to fossil fuels. Biofuels are widely used, especially in Latin America
(e.g., E85  in Brazil, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Biofuels will be
replaced by synthetic fuels (synfuels) within the next few decades.
In the three scenarios, we use region-specific shares of bio- and synfuels to
replace fossil fuels such as diesel, gasoline, and kerosene. Figure 6.19 shows the
scenario-specific band-widths. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, Latin America will increase
its proportion of bio- and synfuels to around 15%, whereas in the Middle East,
Mexico, and Eurasia will even not reach a 0.5% share by 2050. Bio-fuel and
especially synfuel shares will remain constant in the 5.0 °C Scenario, whereas they
will increase in the 2.0  °C Scenario between 2030 and 2050 and in the 1.5  °C
Scenario from 2020 onwards.

**6.3.5 Operational Improvements and Novel Service Concepts**

In addition to technical improvements, such as the energy efficiency savings

described in previous chapters, behavioural changes can potentially reduce energy

demand and help decarbonise the transport sector as a whole. These measures

include, among other things, the efficient operation of vehicles, for example by

increasing the occupancy rates of moving vehicles, reductions in mileages, and

reductions in vehicle stocks.

**6.3.5.1 Passenger Transport**

The classic fixed boundary between private and public transport will blur in the

future as novel platforms and sharing concepts emerge. This trend will potentially

reduce the number and usage of privately owned vehicles. Private car ownership is

generally becoming less a ‘must’ for many people in the car-oriented OECD regions.

Driven by digitization, app-based cars and ride-sharing concepts are emerging.

They include traditional car sharing (e.g., Zipcar), free-floating car sharing busi-

nesses (e.g., car2go), and ride-hailing mobility concepts (e.g., Uber, lyft). In Europe,

private ride-sharing mobility platforms, such as _BlaBlaCar_, are seen as alternative

passenger car usership schemes. All shared-use mobility concepts have in common

that they reduce the vehicle stock and increase occupation rates on trips. To own a

car is no longer considered a status symbol, but has become simply a mode of trans-

port in the Western world.

Flexibility and passenger-friendly usability is becoming increasingly important

to users of public transport. Various app-based on-demand mobility services are

currently being tested in pilot projects—for example, in the German city of

Schorndorf (Brost et  al. [^2018]:). Under these business models, innovative vehicle

concepts are tested for suitability. Automated battery electric (mini) buses can make

public transit more flexible. Their modularity also allows them to connect to other

modes of transport, such as rail and air transport, and thus opens up fundamentally

new transport chains that are more energy efficient than traditional passenger car

usage. However, decision-makers and transport planners must consider the poten-

tially detrimental rebound effects of highly personalized automated mobility

(Pakusch et al. [^2018]:). For example, an increase in total energy consumption may

occur as a result of the higher transport demand arising from transport options that

are seen as more attractive than more-energy-efficient mass transit systems or

cycling. Therefore, novel transport concepts could cancel out the gains in energy

efficiency on a per vehicle level.

**6.3.5.2 Freight Transport**

The automatization of road freight traffic can reduce fuel consumption. The tech-

nology for partially automated trucks is already available and being tested to make

it widely available. In the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) automation level

3 (SAE [^2018]:), (multi-brand) truck platooning has become possible, which is a

driver-assistance technology (Janssen et  al. [^2015]:). With communication between

the first truck and the following trucks, the control of the following vehicles is

```
J. Pagenkopf et al.
```

```
149
```

handed over to the leading vehicle. Thus, the following vehicles are driving in the

slipstream and lower air drag is achieved, which can reduce energy consumption by

up to 5% (Daimler [^2018]:).

In urban freight transport, last-mile delivery concepts based on light commercial

vehicles can help reduce fuel consumption. By fragmenting the transport routes into

the main leg and urban traffic (last mile), different vehicle types and modes can be

used more efficiently for specialized transport tasks. Like light commercial vehicles

(electric), cargo bikes could shape the urban freight traffic of the future as they do

already today in many countries in Asia.

```
Further novel logistic concepts, such as the use of drones for delivery and decen-
```

tralized production using 3D printers, will help to reduce the overall transport

demand and thus energy consumption through more-efficient operational

solutions.

**6.4 Transport Performance**

We outline achievable 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenario paths that will allow us to achieve

very ambitious emission reduction targets. The levels of pkm and tkm for every

world region in 2015 were calibrated against statistical data, the literature, and our

own estimates when concrete data were not available.

```
To complement the anticipated technologically driven mode-inherent improve-
```

ments in efficiency that we took as the input for our modelling in the previous sec-

tions of this chapter, we now describe the scenario assumptions in terms of the

transport mode choices and transport demand. The main idea is to model low-

emission pathways that shift from fossil-dependent, low-energy-efficiency modes

toward more-energy-efficient and electrified modes. We also look at the general

level of performance of transport modes and suggest region-specific development

pathways. We first outline the scenario-specific pkm and tkm pathways to 2050 and

then discuss the rationales for the mode choices that will result in the transport per-

formance projections.

For the 5.0 °C Scenario, we extrapolate current trends in transport performance

until 2050. In relative terms, the transport performance of all transport carriers will

increase from current levels. Aviation, passenger car, and commercial road transport

are particularly projected to grow strongly (Fig. 6.20). These modes consume more

energy than trains, ships, and buses, as discussed in Sect. 6.3.2. Even if the full

efficiency potential of these transport modes is realized, energy intensity per pkm or

tkm will remain higher than that of trains, ships, or buses.

In the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario, we project a strong increase in rail

traffic (starting from a relatively low level) and a slower growth or even a reduction

in the use of the other modes in all world regions (Fig. 6.21). The next two sections

describe the specific changes and developments for each type of passenger and

freight transport.

**6.4.1 Passenger Transport Modes**

To reduce transport-related CO[^2]: emissions, a shift towards low-energy-intensity
modes of transport is required for both ambitious climate-protection scenarios.

Travelling by rail is the most energy-efficient form of transport, and therefore we
suggest a strong shift from domestic aviation to trains, especially high-speed trains
and magnetic levitation trains. The assumed shifts from domestic aviation to trains
are shown in Table 6.1. The mode shift potential differs, depending predominantly
on the country-specific distance between origin–destination pairs. The shifts from
international aviation to trains were not analysed because the potential is lower

(although not zero). The maximum global shift from domestic aviation to trains will
be stronger in the 1.5 °C Scenario than in the 2.0 °C Scenario.
In the urban context, investments in public transit systems and limitations on the
use of private cars are cornerstones of a more-energy-efficient transport system. The
increased use and integration of homes and offices, and video conferencing can
reduce traffic. With further urbanization, two- and three-wheel vehicles are suitable
for travelling small distances quickly. A shift to small and medium cars and away
from larger cars and SUVs will also allow lower energy intensity. Whereas occu-
pancy rates remain steady for the passenger car sector in the 2.0 °C Scenario, in the
1.5 °C Scenario, we assume a significant increase in occupancy rates. Ultimately,
pkm will stabilize, whereas vehicle–km (vkm) will decline in response to incentives
such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes and novel ride-sharing services.
Figure 6.22 shows the development of pkm in all scenarios for sample world
regions. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, pkm in the OECD countries will predominantly
remain on the same level in 2050 as in 2015 due to saturation and sufficiency effects.
In all the other world regions, we project a growth in pkm, reflecting economic
catch-up processes in the developing world induced by increases in population and

GDP.  As can be seen for the 1.5  °C Scenario, India, which represents a strongly

growing economy, will double its pkm by 2050, whereas OECD areas, such as the

USA and Europe, will experience a decline. Although China is expected to experi-

ence continuous economic growth over the next few decades, pkm will rise slowly

compared with that in the 5.0 °C Scenario.

Pkm in absolute numbers in 2050 will be highest in the 5.0 °C Scenario. It will

also increase in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, but at a slower rate (Figs. 6.23 and

6.24).

Looking more closely at the 2.0  °C Scenario, the transport modes will evolve

differently in the world regions, both quantitatively and in relative terms (Fig. 6.25)

due to the diverse mobility patterns. For example, Africa has a high bus share in

total pkm today, whereas OECD Europe has a high passenger car share (LDV), but

pkm must decrease by 2020 and in subsequent years to meet the CO[^2]: reduction
targets because fleet electrification will not be able to keep up. In parallel, rail pkm

will increase strongly until 2050 and this will compensate, in part, the decline in

passenger car pkm. Population and GDP are very likely to catch up in Africa and

will result in a sharp rise in mobility demand. We project that most of this rise to be

covered by informal and formal public transport systems, with buses and mini-

buses. In China, the pkm split among modes is more balanced. All modes are pro-

jected to rise in pkm in the future.

**6.4.2 Freight Transport Modes**

Total freight activity is modelled to increase strongly in the 5.0  °C Scenario and

more slowly in the 2.0 °C Scenario (Fig. 6.26). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, freight trans-

port activity in 2050 is projected to remain at the 2015 level. Freight intensity will

stagnate or decrease in the 1.5 °C Scenario in the OECD countries and increase in

other regions, such as China and India (Figs. 6.26 and 6.27).

We modelled the shift from high-energy-intensity modes to low-energy-intensity

modes, especially from road to rail freight. This will require substantial investments

in additional rail infrastructure. Table 6.2 shows the assumed global tkm shift from

truck to train in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Heavy freight trucks (HFT) are

more likely to operate over long-haul distances, and are therefore more suitable for

the shift to rail freight than light freight trucks (LFT) or medium freight trucks

(MFT). In the 2.0 °C Scenario, we assume an average shift of 18% for HFT, whereas

in the 1.5 °C Scenario, the shift is projected to reach up to 27%. The ramp-up of

shift potential is slow, because the provision of rail and terminal infrastructures and

rolling stock will require considerable time.

We modelled tkm for truck (road) and rail freight transport. In the 5.0  °C

Scenario, transport activity is projected to increase clearly until 2050. In the 2.0 °C

and 1.5 °C Scenarios, this increase will be slower and the tkm on rail will exceed the

road tkm in numbers by 2050 (Fig. 6.28).

```
In the 2.0 °C Scenario, road tkm will decrease in the OECD countries and stag-
```

nate or increase slightly in China (Fig. 6.29). Rail tkm is projected to increase in all

other world regions (Fig. 6.29). Rail tkm in China will temporarily decrease slightly

because of an anticipated medium-term decline in coal transport (Fig. 6.30).

In 2015, rail’s share of total tkm differed between regions, but will increase in the

2.0 °C Scenario in all regions except India, where road tkm will increase more than

rail tkm (Fig. 6.31).

**Energy Scenario Results**

Our scenario modelling involves merging the transport performance for all modes

and powertrains with specific energy demands, and yields the accumulated demands

for electricity, hydrogen, gas, and liquid fuels across all world regions between 2015

and 2050. The transport energy scenario results are outlined in Chap. [^8]:.

#### Renewable Energy Resource Assessment

**Sven Teske, Kriti Nagrath, Tom Morris, and Kate Dooley**

**Abstract** Literature overview of published global and regional renewable energy

potential estimates. This section provides definitions for different types of RE

potentials and introduces a new category, the economic renewable energy potential

in space constrained environments. The potential for utility scale solar and onshore

wind in square kilometre and maximum possible installed capacity (in GW) are

provided for 75 different regions. The results set the upper limits for the deployment

of solar- and wind technologies for the development of the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C energy

pathways.

There is a wide range of estimates of global and regional renewable energy poten-

tials in the literature, and all conclude that the total global technical renewable

energy potential is substantially higher than the current global energy demand

(IPCC/SRREN [^2011]:). Furthermore, the IPCC has concluded that the _global techni-_

_cal renewable energy potential will not limit continued renewable energy growth_

(IPCC/SRREN [^2011]:). However, the technical potential is also much higher than the

sustainable potential, which is limited by factors such as land availability and other

resource constraints.

This chapter provides an overview of various estimates of global renewable

energy (RE) potential. It also provides definitions of different types of RE potential

and presents mapping results for the spatial RE resource analysis (see Sect. 1.3 in

Chap. [^3]:)—[R]E-SPACE. The [R]E-SPACE results provide the upper limit for the

deployment of all solar and wind technologies used in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

Scenarios.

**7.1 Global Renewable Energy Potentials**

The International Panel on Climate Change—Special Report on Renewable Energy

Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (IPCC-SRRN [^2011]:) defines renewable

energy (RE) as:

```
“ (...) any form of energy from solar, geophysical or biological sources that is replenished
by natural processes at a rate that equals or exceeds its rate of use. Renewable energy is
obtained from the continuing or repetitive flows of energy occurring in the natural environ-
ment and includes low-carbon technologies such as solar energy, hydropower, wind, tide
and waves and ocean thermal energy, as well as renewable fuels such as biomass.”
```

For the development of the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, an additional renewable

energy potential—the economic renewable energy potential in a space-constrained

environment (Sect. 3.2 in Chap. [^3]:)—has been analysed and utilized in this study.

The theoretical and technical potentials of renewable energy are significantly

larger than the current global primary energy demand. The minimum technical

potential of solar energy, shown in Table 7.1 (Turkenburg et al. [^2012]:), could supply

the global primary energy of 2015 112 times over.

However, the technical potential is only a first indication of the extent to

which the resource is available. There are many other limitations, which must be

considered. One of the main constraints on deploying renewable energy tech-

```
Different types of renewable energy potentials have been identified by the
German Advisory Council on Climate Change (WBGU)—World in Transition:
Towards Sustainable Energy Systems, Chap. 3, page 44, published in 2003:
(WBGU 2003) (Quote):
```

```
“Theoretical potential: The theoretical potential identifies the physical upper limit of
the energy available from a certain source. For solar energy, for example, this would
be the total solar radiation falling on a particular surface. This potential does there-
fore not take account of any restrictions on utilization, nor is the efficiency of the
conversion technologies considered.
Conversion potential: The conversion potential is defined specifically for
each technology and is derived from the theoretical potential and the annual effi-
ciency of the respective conversion technology. The conversion potential is
therefore not a strictly defined value, since the efficiency of a particular technol-
ogy depends on technological progress.
Technological potential: The technological potential is derived from the conver-
sion potential, taking account of additional restrictions regarding the area that is real-
istically available for energy generation. [...] like the conversion potential, the
technological potential of the different energy sources is therefore not a strictly
defined value but depends on numerous boundary conditions and assumptions.
Economic potential: This potential identifies the proportion of the technological
potential that can be utilized economically, based on economic boundary conditions
at a certain time [...].
Sustainable potential: This potential of an energy source covers all aspects of
sustainability, which usually requires careful consideration and evaluation of differ-
ent ecological and socio-economic aspects [...].” (END Quote)

nologies is the available space, especially in densely populated areas where there
are competing claims on land use, such as agriculture and nature conservation, to
name just two.
It is neither necessary nor desirable to exploit the entire technical potential. The
implementation of renewable energy must respect sustainability criteria to achieve
a sound future energy supply. Public acceptance is crucial, especially because the
decentralised character of many renewable energy technologies will move systems
closer to consumers. Without public acceptance, market expansion will be difficult
or even impossible (Teske and Pregger [^2015]:). The energy policy framework in a
particular country or region will have a profound impact on the expansion of renew-
ables, in terms of both the economic situation and the social acceptance of renew-
able energy projects.

**7.1.1 Bioenergy**

The discrepancy between the technical potential for bioenergy and the likely sus-
tainable potential raises some issues that warrant further discussion. Recent analy-
ses put the technical potential for primary bioenergy supply at 100–300 EJ/year.
(GEA [^2012]:; Smith et al. [^2014]:). However, the dedicated use of land for bioenergy—
whether through energy crops or the harvest of forest biomass—raises concerns
over competition for land and the carbon neutrality of bioenergy (Field and Mach
[^2017]:; Searchinger et  al. [^2017]:). Research that focused on the trade-offs between
bioenergy production, food security, and biodiversity found that less than 100 EJ /
year. could be produced sustainably (Boysen et al. [^2017]:; Heck et al. [^2018]:), although
such production levels would be dependent on strong global land governance sys-
tems (Creutzig [^2017]:).
The carbon neutrality of bioenergy is based on the assumption that the CO2
released when bioenergy is combusted is then recaptured when the biomass stock

regrows (EASAC [^2017]:). Most land is part of the terrestrial carbon sink or is used
for food production, so that harvesting for bioenergy will either deplete the exist-
ing carbon stock or displace food production (Searchinger et al. [^2015]:, [^2017]:). The
use of harvested forest products (e.g., wood pellets) for bioenergy is not carbon
neutral in the majority of circumstances because an increased harvesting in forests
leads to a permanent increase in the atmospheric CO[^2]: concentration (Sterman et al.
[^2018]:; Smyth et  al. [^2014]:; Ter Mikaelian et  al. [^2015]:). Leaving carbon stored in

intact forests can represent a better climate mitigation strategy (DeCicco and

Schlesinger [^2018]:), because increased atmospheric concentrations of CO[^2]: from the
burning of bioenergy may worsen the irreversible impacts of climate change before

the forests can grow back to compensate the increase (EASAC [^2017]:; Booth [^2018]:;
Schlesinger [^2018]:).
Bioenergy sourced from wastes and residues rather than harvested from dedi-
cated land can be considered carbon neutral, because of the ‘carbon opportunity
cost’ per hectare of land (i.e., bioenergy production reduces the carbon-carrying
capacity of land) (Searchinger et al. [^2017]:). The supply of waste and residues as
a bioenergy source is always inherently limited (Miyake et al. [^2012]:). Although
in some cases, burning residues can still release more emissions into the atmo-
sphere in the mid-term (20–40 years) than allowing them to decay (Booth [^2018]:),
there is general agreement that specific and limited waste materials from the for-
est industry (for example, black liquor or sawdust) can be used with beneficial
climate effects (EASAC [^2017]:). The use of secondary residues (cascade utiliza-
tion) may reduce the logistical costs and trade-offs associated with waste use
(Smith et al. [^2014]:).

**7.2 Economic Renewable Energy Potential in Space-**
**Constrained Environments**

Land is a scarce resource. The use of land for nature conservation, agricultural pro-
duction, residential areas, and industry, as well as for infrastructure, such as roads
and all aspects of human settlements, limits the amount of land available land for
utility-scale solar and wind projects. Furthermore, solar and wind generation require
favourable climatic conditions, so not all available areas are suitable for renewable
power generation. To assess the renewable energy potential of the available area, all
ten world regions defined in Table 8 in Sect. 1 of Chap. [^5]: were analysed with the [R]
E-SPACE methodology described in Sect. 3 of Chap. [^3]:.
Given the issues involved in dedicated land-use for bioenergy outlined above, we
assume that bioenergy is sourced primarily from cascading residue use and wastes,
and do not analyse the availability of land for dedicated bioenergy crops.
This analysis quantifies the available land area (in square kilometres) in all
regions and sub-regions with a defined set of constraints.

**7.2.1 Constrains for Utility-Scale Solar and Wind Power**

**Plants**

The following land-use areas were excluded from the deployment of utility-scale

solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power plants:

• Residential and urban settlements;
• Infrastructure for transport (e.g., rail, roads);
• Industrial areas;
• Intensive agricultural production land;
• Nature conservation areas and national parks;
• Wetlands and swamps;
• Closed grasslands (a land-use type) (GLC [^2000]:).

**7.2.2 Mapping Solar and Wind Potential**

After the spatial analysis, the remaining available land areas were analysed for their

solar and wind resources. For concentrated solar power, a minimum solar radiation

of 2000 kilowatt hours per square meter and year (kWh/m[^2] year) is assumed as the

minimum deployment criterion, and onshore wind potentials under an average
annual wind speed of 5 m/s have been omitted.
In the next step, the existing electricity infrastructure of power lines and power
plants was mapped for all regions with WRI ([^2018]:) data. Figure 7.1 provides an
example of the electricity infrastructure in Africa. These maps provide important
insights into the current situation in the power sector, especially the availability of
transmission grids. This is of particular interest for developing countries because it
allows a comparison of the available land areas that have favourable solar and wind
conditions with the infrastructure available to transport electricity to the demand
centres. This assessment is less important for OECD regions because the energy
infrastructure is usually already fairly evenly distributed across the country—except
in some parts of Canada, the United States, and Australia. For some countries, cov-
erage is not 100% complete due to a lack of public data sources. This is particularly
true for renewable energy generation assets such as solar, wind, biomass, geother-
mal energy, and hydropower resources.
Figure 7.2 shows the solar potential for utility-scale solar power plants—both
solar PV and concentrated solar power—in Africa. The scale from light yellow to
dark red shows the solar radiation intensity: the darker the area, the better the solar
resource. The green lines show existing transmission lines. All areas that are not
yellow or red are unsuitable for utility-scale solar because there is conflicting land
use and/or there are no suitable solar resources. Africa provides a very extreme
example of very good solar resources far from existing infrastructure. While roof-top

solar PV can be deployed virtually anywhere and only needs roof space on any sort
of building, bulk power supply via solar—to produce synthetic and hydrogen
fuels—requires a certain minimum of utility-scale solar applications. The vast solar
potential in the north of Africa—as well as in the Middle East—has been earmarked
for the production of synthetic and hydrogen fuels and for the export of renewable
electricity (via sub-sea cable) to Europe in the long-term energy scenarios in the
2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios.
Europe, in contrast, is densely populated and has fewer favourable utility-scale
solar sites because of both its lower solar radiation and conflicting land-use patterns.
Figure 7.3 shows Europe’s potential for utility-scale solar power plants. Only the
yellow and red dots across Europe, most visible in the south of Spain, south of the
Alps, south-west Italy, and the Asian part of Turkey, mark regions suitable for
utility-scale solar, whereas roof-top solar can be deployed economically across
Europe, including Scandinavia.
However, Africa and Europe are in a good position, from a technical point of
view, to form an economic partnership for solar energy exchange.
The situation for onshore wind power differs from that for solar energy. The best
potential is in areas that are more than 30° north and south of the equator, whereas
the actual equatorial zone is less suitable for wind installation. North America has
significant wind resources and the resource is still largely untapped, even though
there is already a mature wind industry in Canada and the USA. Figure 7.4 shows
the existing and potential wind power sites. While significant wind power

installations are already in operation, mainly in the USA, there are still very large
untapped resources across the entire north American continent, in Canada and the
mid-west of the USA.
Unlike the situation in the USA, wind power in Latin America is still in its initial
stages and the industry, which has great potential, is still in its infancy. Figure 7.5
shows the existing wind farm locations—marked with blue dots—and the potential
wind farm sites, especially in coastal regions and the entire southern parts of
Argentina and Chile.
The available solar and wind potentials are distributed differently across all
world regions. Whereas some regions have significantly more resources than others,
all regions have enough potential to supply their demand with local solar and wind
resources—together with other renewable energy resources, such as hydro-, bio-,
and geothermal energies.
Table 7.2 provides an overview of the key results of the [R]E-SPACE analysis.
The available areas (in square kilometres) are based on the space-constrained
assumptions (see Sect. 2.1 in Chap. [^7]:). The installed capacities are calculated based
on the following space requirements (Table 7.2):

• Solar photovoltaic: 1 MW = 0.04 km[^2]
• Concentrated solar power: 1 MW = 0.04 km[^2]
• Onshore wind: 1 MW = 0.2 km[^2]

Note: Mapping Eurasia was not possible because the data files were
incomplete.

#### Energy Scenario Results

**Sven Teske, Thomas Pregger, Tobias Naegler, Sonja Simon,**

**Johannes Pagenkopf, Bent van den Adel, and Özcan Deniz**

**Abstract** Results for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios for ten world regions

in regard to energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions, final-, primary-, transport-

and heating demand and the deployment of various supply technologies to meet the

demand. Furthermore, the electricity demand and generation scenarios are pro-

vided. The key results of a power sector analysis which simulates further electricity

supply with high shares of solar- and wind power in one hour steps is provided. The

ten world regions are divided into eight sub-regions and the expected development

of loads, capacity-factors for various power plant types and storage demands are

provided. This chapter contains more than 100 figures and tables.

This chapter provides a condensed description of the energy scenario results on a

global scale, for each of the ten world regions. The descriptions include a presenta-

tion of the calculated energy demands for all sectors (power and heat/fuels for the

following sectors: industry, residential and other, and transport) and of supply strat-

egies for all the technologies considered, from 2015 to 2050. The results of the

model-based analyses of hourly supply curves and required storage capacities are

also discussed based on key indicators. Graphs, tables, and descriptions are pro-

vided in a standardized way to facilitate comparisons between scenarios and

between regions.

The following global summary of the regional results is presented in the same

structure as that used for individual regions. Consistent with the regional results,

these tables do not include the demand and supply details for the bunker fuels used

in international aviation and navigation. Section 8.2 outlines a global demand and

supply scenario for renewable bunker fuels in the long term, including estimates of

additional CO[^2]: emissions from fossil bunker fuels between 2015 and 2050.

**8.1 Global: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.1.1 Global: Projection of Overall Energy Intensity**

Combining the assumptions for the power, heat, and fuel demands for all sectors

produced the overall final energy intensity (per $ GDP) development shown in

Fig. 8.1. Compared with the 5.0 °C case based on the Current Policies Scenario of

the IEA, the alternative scenarios follow more stringent efficiency levels. The 1.5 °C

Scenario represents an even faster implementation of efficiency measures than the

2.0  °C Scenario. The 1.5  °C Scenario involves the decelerated growth of energy

services in all regions, to avoid any further strong increase in fossil fuel use after

2020. The global average intensity drops from 2.4  MJ/$GDP in 2015 to

1.25  MJ/$GDP in 2050  in the 5.0  °C case compared with 0.65  MJ/$GDP in the

2.0 °C Scenario and 0.59 MJ/$GDP in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The average final energy

consumption decreases from 46.3 GJ/capita in 2015 to 28.4 GJ/capita in 2050 in the

2.0 °C Scenario and to below 26 GJ/capita in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In the 5.0 °C case,

it increases to 55 GJ/capita.

**8.1.2 Global: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

**(Excluding Bunkers)**

Combining the assumptions for population growth, GDP growth, and energy inten-

sity produced the future development pathways for the global final energy demand

shown in Fig. 8.2 for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios. In the 5.0 °C Scenario,

the total final energy demand will increase by 57% from 342 EJ/year in 2015 to 537

EJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy demand will decrease by

19% compared with the current consumption and reach 278  EJ/year by 2050,

whereas the final energy demand in the 1.5  °C Scenario will reach 253 EJ, 26%

below the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final energy demand in 2050 is

9% lower than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The electricity demand for ‘classical’ electri-

cal devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will increase from around

15,900  TWh/year in 2015 to 23,800 TWh/year (2.0  °C) or to 23,300  TWh/year

(1.5 °C) by 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (37,000 TWh/year in 2050), the

efficiency measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will save 13,200 TWh/year

and 13,700 TWh/year, respectively, by 2050.

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be about

12,600 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector

there will be an increase of about 23,400 TWh/year due to increased electric mobil-

ity. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process heat)

and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an additional

power demand of 18,800 TWh/year The gross power demand will thus rise from

24,300 TWh/year in 2015 to 65,900 TWh/year in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario, 34%

higher than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the gross electricity demand

will increase to a maximum of 65,300 TWh/year in 2050.

The efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the

electricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption

equivalent to about 85.7 EJ/year and 95.4 EJ/year, respectively, is avoided

through efficiency gains by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario (Figs. 8.3,

8.4, 8.5, and 8.6).

**8.1.3 Global: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power coming from

renewable sources. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, 100% of the electricity produced glob-

ally will come from renewable energy sources by 2050. ‘New’ renewables—mainly

wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 83% of the total electricity

generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 62% by

2030 and 88% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 9500

in 2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario is assumed to be 73%. The 1.5 °C Scenario indicates

a generation capacity from renewable energy of about 25,700 GW in 2050.

structure. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and photovoltaic

(PV), up to 7850 GW and 12,300 GW, respectively, will be complemented by up to

2060 GW of solar thermal generation, and limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean

energy in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario will

lead to a high proportion of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of

38% and 46%, respectively, by 2030 and 64% and 65%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.1.4 Global: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.8 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated average
electricity generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 6 ct/kWh.

In the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when they reach
10.6 ct/kWh. The generation costs will also increase in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C
Scenarios until 2030, when they will reach 9 ct/kWh, and then drop to 7 ct/kWh by

2050. In both alternative scenarios, the generation costs will be around 3.5 ct/kWh
lower than in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 2050. Note that these estimates of generation
costs do not take into account integration costs such as power grid expansion, stor-
age, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to increase from today’s $1560 billion/year to
around $5500 billion/year in 2050. In both alternative scenarios, the total supply
costs will be $5050 billion/year in 2050. Therefore, the long-term costs for electric-
ity supply in both alternative scenarios are about 8% lower than in the 5.0  °C
Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and the electrification of
heating and mobility.

Compared with these results, the generation costs (without including CO[^2]: emis-
sion costs) will increase in the 5.0 °C case to only 7.9 ct/kWh. The generation costs

will increase in the 2.0 °C Scenario until 2030 to 7.7 ct/kWh and to a maximum of

8.1 ct/kWh in the 1.5 °C Scenario. Between 2030 and 2050, the costs will decrease

to 7 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the generation costs will be, at maximum,

0.1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C Scenario and this will occur in 2040. In the

1.5 °C Scenario, the generation costs will be, at maximum, 0.5 ct/kWh higher than

in the 5.0 °C Scenario, again by around 2040. In 2050, the generation costs in the

alternative scenarios will be 0.8–0.9 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0  °C case. If the

CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total electricity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will
rise to about $4150 billion/year in 2050.

**8.1.5 Global: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

In the 2.0  °C Scenario, around $49,000 billion in investment will be required for
power generation between 2015 and 2050—including for additional power plants to
produce hydrogen and synthetic fuels and for the plant replacement costs at the end
of their economic lifetimes. This value will be equivalent to approximately $1360
billion per year on average, and is $28,600 billion more than in the 5.0  °C case
($20,400 billion). An investment of around $51,000 billion for power generation
will be required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average, this
will be an investment of $1420 billion per year. In the 5.0  °C Scenario, the

investment in conventional power plants will comprises around 40% of total cumu-
lative investments, whereas approximately 60% will be invested in renewable power
generation and co-generation (Fig. 8.9).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, the world will shift almost 94% (95%)
of its total energy investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil
fuel share of the power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas power
plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $26,300 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $730 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings in the
2.0  °C Scenario will be equivalent to 90% of the additional energy investments
compared to the 5.0 °C Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will
add up to $28,800 billion, or $800 billion per year.

**8.1.6 Global: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 59%, from
151 EJ/year in 2015 to around 240 EJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, energy
efficiency measures will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 36% in
2050, relative to that in the 5.0 °C Scenario, and by 40% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. Today,
renewables supply around 20% of the global final energy demand for heating. The

main contribution is from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 42% of the world’s
total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 56% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In
both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.
Figure 8.10 shows the development of different technologies for heating world-
wide over time, and Table 8.2 provides the resulting renewable heat supply for all
scenarios. Until 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor. In the long-term,
the growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead to a biomass
share in total heating of 33% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 30% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.
Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels
in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 15,900 PJ/year in

the 2.0  °C Scenario and 17,200 PJ/year in the 1.5  °C Scenario. The direct use of

electricity for heating will also increase by a factor of 4.2–4.5 between 2015 and

2050 and will have a final share of 26% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 30% in

the 1.5 °C Scenario (Table 8.2).

**8.1.7 Global: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $13,230 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments

for plant replacement after their economic lifetimes)—approximately $368 billion

per year. The largest share of this investment is assumed to be for heat pumps (around

$5700 billion), followed by solar collectors and geothermal heat use. The 1.5  °C

Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technologies. However, the

lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0 °C Scenario) will result in a lower aver-

age annual investment of around $344 billion per year (Table 8.3, Fig. 8.11).

**8.1.8 Global: Transport**

The energy demand in the transport sector will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by

50% by 2050, from around 97,200 PJ/year in 2015 to 145,700 PJ/year in 2050. In

the 2.0  °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes will

reduce the energy demand by 66% (96,000 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the

5.0 °C Scenario. Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in

the transport demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario

of 74% (or 108,000 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0  °C case (Table 8.4,

Fig. 8.12).

By 2030, electricity will provide 12% (2700 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s

total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 47%

(6500 TWh/year). In 2050, around 8430 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the

transport sector, as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the

annual electricity demand will be about 5200 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario

also assumes a hydrogen demand of 6850 PJ/year by 2050.

Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0 °C Scenario to a maximum of around 12,000 PJ/

year Therefore, by around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be

introduced, with a maximum amount of 5820 PJ/year in 2050. Because of the lower

overall energy demand by transport, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5  °C

Scenario to a maximum of 10,000 PJ/year The maximum synthetic fuel demand

will amount to 6300 PJ/year.

**8.1.9 Global: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the annual global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions will increase
by 40%, from 31,180 Mt. in 2015 to more than 43,500 Mt. in 2050. The stringent

mitigation measures in both alternative scenarios will cause annual emissions to fall
to 7070 Mt. in 2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 2650 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario,
with further reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the cumula-
tive CO[^2]: emissions from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 1388 Gt. In contrast, in the
2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period 2015–2050

will be 587 Gt and 450 Gt, respectively.

## Fig. 8.12 Global: final energy consumption by transport in the scenarios

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

188

Thus, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 58% in the 2.0 °C Scenario
and by 68% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid reduction
in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C Scenario,
the reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by the ‘Residential
and other’ and ‘Transport’ sectors (Fig. 8.13).

**8.1.10 Global: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption based on the assumptions discussed

above in the three scenarios are shown in Fig. 8.14. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the pri-

mary energy demand will decrease by 21%, from around 556 EJ/year in 2015 to 439

EJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario, the overall primary energy

demand will decrease by 48% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario (5.0 °C: 837 EJ in

2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will be even lower (412

EJ in 2050) due to the lower final energy demand and lower conversion losses.

Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This

will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 35% in 2030 and

92% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a

primary energy share of more than 92% in 2050 (this will includes non-energy con-

sumption, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out in

both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy consumption

of natural gas in the 5.0 °C Scenario will be 5580 EJ, the cumulative coal consump-

tion will be about 6360 EJ, and the crude oil consumption will be 6380 EJ. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 3140 EJ, the cumulative

coal demand to 2340 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 2960 EJ. Even lower fos-

sil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 2710 EJ for natural gas, 1570 EJ

for coal, and 2230 EJ for oil.

**8.2 Global: Bunker Fuels**

Bunker fuels for international aviation and navigation are separate categories in the

energy statistics. Their use and related emissions are not usually directly allocated

to the regional energy balances. However, they contribute significantly to global

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pose great challenges regarding their substi-

tution with low-carbon alternatives. In 2015, the annual bunker fuels consumption

was in the order of 16,000 PJ, of which 7400 PJ was for aviation and 8600 PJ for

navigation. Between 2009 and 2015, bunker fuel consumption increased by 13%.

The annual CO[^2]: emissions from bunker fuels accounted for 1.3 Gt in 2015, approxi-

mately 4% of global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions. In the 5.0  °C Scenario, the
development of the final energy demand for bunker fuels is assumed to be that of the
IEA World Energy Outlook 2017 Current Policies scenario. This will lead to a fur-
ther increase of 120% in the demand for bunker fuels until 2050 compared with that
in the base year, 2015. Because no substitution with ‘green’ fuels is assumed, CO2
emissions will rise by the same order of magnitude.

Although the use of hydrogen and electricity in aviation is technically feasible (at
least for regional transport) and synthetic gas use in navigation is an additional option
under discussion, this analysis uses a conservative approach and assumes that bunker
fuels are only replaced by biofuels or synthetic liquid fuels. Figure 8.15 shows the
5.0 °C and two alternative bunker scenarios, which are defined in consistency to the
scenarios for each world region. For the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, we assume the
limited use of sustainable biomass potentials and the complementary central produc-
tion of power-to-liquid synfuels. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, this production is assumed
to take place in three world regions: Africa, the Middle East, and OECD Pacific
(especially Australia), where synfuel generation for export is expected to be the most
economic. The 1.5 °C Scenario requires even faster decarbonisation, and therefore
follows a more ambitious low-energy pathway. This will lead to a faster build-up of
the power-to-liquid infrastructure in all regions, which in the long term, will also be
used for limited ‘regional’ bunker fuel production to maintain the utilization of the
existing infrastructure. Therefore, the production of bunker fuels is assumed to occur
in more regions, with lower exports from the supply regions mentioned above, in the
2.0  °C Scenario. Another assumption is that, consistent with the regional 1.5  °C
Scenarios, the biomass consumption for energy supply will decrease in the long term,
whereas power-to-liquid will continue to increase as the main option for international
aviation and navigation. Finally, the expansion of the power-to-liquid infrastructure
for the generation of bunker fuel will be closely associated with the assumed devel-
opment of regional synthetic fuel demand and generation for transportation in each
world region. Figure 8.15 also shows the resulting cumulative CO[^2]: emissions from
bunker fuel consumption between 2015 and 2050, which amount to around 70 Gt in
the 5.0  °C case, 30 Gt in the 2.0  °C Scenario, and 21 Gt in the 1.5  °C Scenario.
Table 8.5 provides more-detailed data for the three bunker fuel scenarios.

The production of synthetic fuels will cause significant additional electricity

demand and a corresponding expansion of the renewable power generation

capacities. In the case of liquid bunker fuels, these additional renewable power

generation capacities will amount to 1100 GW in the 2.0  °C Scenario and more

than 1200 GW in the 1.5 °C Scenario if a flexible utilization rate of 4000 full-load

hours per year can be achieved. However, such a situation will require high amounts

of electrolyser capacity and hydrogen storage to allow not only flexibility in the

power system, but also high utilization rates of the downstream synthesis processes

(e.g., via Fischer-Tropsch plants). Other options for renewable synthetic fuel pro-

duction are solar thermal chemical processes, which directly use high-temperature

solar heat.

**8.3 Global: Utilization of Solar and Wind Potential**

The economic potential, under space constraints, of utility solar PV, concentrated

solar power (CSP), and onshore wind was analysed with the methodology described

in Sect. 3.3 of Chap. [^3]:.

The 2.0 °C Scenario utilizes only a fraction of the available economic potential

of the assumed suitable land for utility-scale solar PV and concentrated solar power

plants. This estimate does not include solar PV roof-top systems, which have sig-

nificant additional potential. India (2.0  °C) will have the highest solar utilization

rate of 8.5%, followed by Europe (2.0 °C) and the Middle East (2.0 °C), with 5.9%

and 4.6%, respectively.

Onshore wind potential has been utilized to a larger extent than solar potential.

In the 2.0 °C Scenario, space-constrained India will utilize more than half of onshore

wind, followed by Europe with 20%. This wind potential excludes offshore wind,

which has significant potential but the mapping for the offshore wind potential was

beyond the scope of this analysis (Table 8.6).

The 1.5  °C Scenario is based on the accelerated deployment of all renewables

and the more ambitious implementation of efficiency measures. Therefore, the total

installed capacity of solar and wind generators by 2050 is not necessarily larger than

it is in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and the utilization rate is in the same order of magnitude.

The increased deployment of renewable capacity in OECD Pacific (Australia), the

Middle East, and OECD North America (USA) will be due to the production of

synthetic bunker fuels from hydrogen to supply global transport energy for interna-

tional shipping and aviation.

**8.4 Global: Power Sector Analysis**

The long-term global and regional energy results were used to conduct a detailed
power sector analysis with the methodology described in Sect. 3.5 of Chap. [^3]:. Both
the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios rely on high shares of variable solar and wind genera-
tion. The aim of the power sector analysis was to gain insight into the power system
stability for each region (subdivided into up to eight sub-regions) and to gauge the
extent to which power grid interconnections, dispatch generation services, and storage
technologies are required. The results presented in this chapter are projections calcu-
lated from publicly available data. Detailed load curves for some of the sub-regions
and countries discussed in this chapter were not available and, in some cases, the rel-
evant information is classified. Therefore, the outcomes of the [R]E 24/7 model are
estimates and require further research with more detailed localized data, especially
regarding the available power grid infrastructure. Furthermore, power sector projec-
tions for developing countries, especially in Africa and Asia, assume unilateral access
to energy services for the residential sector by 2050, and they require transmission and
distribution grids in regions where there are none at the time of writing. Further
research—in cooperation with local utilities and government representatives—is
required to develop a more detailed understanding of power infrastructure needs.

**8.4.1 Global: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The size of the global market for renewable power plants will increase significantly
under the 2.0  °C Scenario. The annual market for solar PV power must increase
from close to 100 GW in 2017 (REN21-GSR [^2018]:) by a factor of 4.5 to an average
of 454 GW by 2030. The onshore wind market must expand to 172 GW by 2025,
about three times higher than in 2017 (REN21-GSR [^2018]:). The offshore wind mar-
ket will continue to increase in importance within the renewable power sector. By
2050, offshore wind installations will increase to 32 GW annually—11 times higher
than in 2017 (GWEC [^2018]:). Concentrated solar power plants will play an important
role in dispatchable solar electricity generation for the supply of bulk power, espe-
cially for industry, and will provide secured capacity to power systems. By 2030,
the annual CSP market must increase to 78 GW, compared with 3 GW in 2020 and
only 0.1 GW in 2017 (REN21-GSR2018) (Table 8.7).
In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the phase-out of coal and lignite power plants is acceler-
ated and a total capacity of 618 GW—equivalent to approximately 515 power sta-
tions[^1]—must end operation by 2025. The replacement power must come from a

variety of renewable power generators, both variable and dispatchable. The annual

market for solar PV must be around 30% higher in 2050 than it was in 2025, as in the

2.0 °C Scenario. While the onshore wind market also has an accelerated trajectory

[^1]:Assumption: average size of one coal power plant side contains multiple generation blocks, with
a total of 1200 MW on average for each location.

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

196

under the 1.5 °C Scenario as well, the offshore wind market is assumed to be almost

identical to that in the 2.0  °C pathway because of the longer lead times for these

projects. The same is assumed for CSP plants, which are utility-scale projects and

significantly higher deployment seems unlikely in the time remaining until 2025.

**8.4.2 Global: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

On a global scale, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, the shares of variable renew-

able power generation will increase from 4% in 2015 to 39% and 47%, respectively,

by 2030, and to 64% and 60%, respectively, by 2050. The reason for the variations

in the two cases is their different assumptions regarding efficiency measures, which

may lead to lower overall demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario than in the 2.0 °C Scenario.

During the same period, dispatchable renewables—CSP plants, biofuel generation,

geothermal energy, and hydropower—will remain around 32% until 2030 on a

global average and decrease slightly to 29% in the 2.0 °C Scenario (and to 27% in

the 1.5 °C Scenario) by 2050. The shares of dispatchable conventional generation—

mainly coal, oil, gas, and nuclear—will decline from a global average of 60% in

2015 to only 14% in 2040. By 2050, the remaining dispatchable conventional gas

power plants will have been converted to operate with hydrogen and synthetic fuels,

to avoid stranded investments and to achieve higher quantities of dispatch power

capacity. Table  8.8 shows the increasing shares of variable renewable power

generation—solar PV and wind power—under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios over
the entire modelling period. The main difference between the two scenarios is the
time horizon until variable renewable power generation is implemented, with more
rapid implementation in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Again, increased variable shares—
mainly in the USA, the Middle East region, and Australia—will produce synthetic
fuels for the export market, as fuel for both renewable power plants and the trans-
port sector.
Table 8.9 provides an overview of the capacity factor developments by technol-
ogy group for the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The operational hours shown are
the result of [R]E 24/7 modelling under the _‘Dispatch case’,_ which assumes that
the highest priority is given to the dispatch of power from variable sources, fol-
lowed by dispatchable renewables. Conventional power generation will only pro-
vide power for electricity demand that cannot be met by renewables and storage
technologies. Only imports via interconnections will be assigned a lower priority
than conventional power. The reason that interconnections are placed last in the
supply cascade is the high level of uncertainty about whether these interconnec-
tions can actually be implemented in time. Experience with power grid projects—
especially transmission lines—indicates that planning and construction can take
many years or fail entirely, leaving large-scale utility-based renewable power
projects unbuilt.

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```
199
```

```
On the global level, the average capacity factor across all power-generation tech-
```

nologies is around 45%. For this analysis, we created five different power plant

categories based on their current usual operation times and areas of use:

• **Limited dispatchable fossil and nuclear power plants**: coal, lignite, and

```
nuclear power plants with limited ability to respond to changes in demand. These
power plants are historically categorized as ‘baseload power plants’. Power sys-
tems dominated by renewable energy usually contain high proportions of vari-
able generation, and therefore quick reaction times (to ramp up and down) are
required. Limited dispatchable power plants cannot deliver these services and are
therefore being phased-out.
```

• **Limited dispatchable renewable systems** are CSP plants with integrated stor-

```
age and co-generation systems with renewable fuels (including geothermal heat).
They cannot respond quickly enough to adapt to minute-by-minute changes in
demand, but can still be used as dispatch power plants for ‘day ahead’
planning.
```

• **Dispatchable fossil fuel power plants** are gas power plants that have very quick

reaction times and therefore provide valid power system services.

• **Dispatchable renewable power plants** are hydropower plants (although they

```
are dependent on the climatic conditions in the region where the plant is used),
biogas power plants, and former gas power plants converted to hydrogen and/or
synthetic fuel. This technology group is responsible for most of the required
load-balancing services and is vital for the stability of the power system, as stor-
age systems, interconnections, and, if possible, demand-side management.
```

• **Variable renewables** are solar PV plants, onshore and offshore wind farms, and

```
ocean energy generators. A sub-category of ocean energy plants—tidal energy
plants—is very predictable.
```

```
Table 8.9 shows the development of the utilization of limited and fully dispatch-
```

able power generators—both fossil and renewable fuels—and variable power gen-

eration. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, conventional power generation in the baseload

mode—currently with an annual operation time of around 6000  h per year or

more—will decline sharply after 2030 and the annual operation time will be halved,

whereas medium-load and dispatch power plants will predominate. The system

share of dispatchable renewables will remain around 45%–50% throughout the

entire modelling period.

## Fig. 8.16 Development of maximum load in 10 world regions in 2020, 2030, and 2050  in the

2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios

this analysis is the load remaining after variable renewable power generation.
Negative values indicate that the power generation from solar and wind exceeds the
actual load and must be exported to other regions, stored, or curtailed. In each
region, the average generation should be on the same level as the average load. The
maximum loads and maximum generations shown do not usually occur at the same
time, so surplus production of electricity can appear and this should be exported or
stored as much as possible. In rare individual cases, solar or wind generation plants
can also temporarily reduce their output to a lower load, or some plants can be shut
down. Any reduced generation from solar and wind in response to low demand is
defined as _curtailment_.
Figure 8.16 illustrates the development of the maximum loads across all 10
world regions under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The most significant increase
appears in Africa, where the maximum load surges over the entire modelling period
by 534% in response to favourable economic development and increased access to

energy services by households. In OECD Pacific, efficiency measures will lead to a
reduction in the maximum load to 87% of the base year value by 2030 and will
increase to 116% by 2050 with the expansion of electric mobility and the increased
electrification of the process heat supply in the industry sector. The 1.5 °C Scenario
has slightly higher loads in response to the accelerated electrification of the indus-
try, heating, and business sectors, except in three regions (the Middle East, India,
and Non OECD Asia), where early action on efficiency measures will lead to an
overall lower demand at the end of the modelling period, with the same GDP and
population growth rates.

**8.4.4 Global System-Relevant Technologies—Storage**
**and Dispatch**

The global results of introducing system-relevant technologies are shown in
Table 8.8. The first part of this section documents the required power plant markets,
the changes and configurations of power-generation systems, and the development
of loads in response to high electrification rates in the industry, heating, and trans-
port sectors. The next step in the analysis documents the storage and dispatch
demands and possible technology utilization. It is important to note that the results
presented here are not cost-optimized. The mixture of battery storage and pumped
hydropower plants with hydrogen- and synthetic-fuel-based dispatch power plants
presented here represents only one option of many.
Significant simplification is required for the computer simulations of large
regions, to reduce the data volumes (and calculation times) or simply because there
is not yet any data, because several regions still have no electricity infrastructure in
place. Detailed modelling requires access to detailed data. Although the modelling
tools used for this analysis could be used to develop significantly more-detailed
regional analyses, this is beyond the scope of this research.
The basic concept for the management of power system generation is based on
four principles:

1. Diversity;
2. Flexibility;
3. Inter-sectorial connectivity;
4. Resource efficiency.

_Diversity_ in the locally deployed renewable power-generation structure. For exam-

ple, a combination of onshore and offshore wind with solar PV and CSP plants will

reduce storage and dispatch demands.

_Flexibility_ involves a significant number of fast-reacting dispatch power plants

operated with fuels produced from renewable electricity (hydrogen and synthetic
fuels). The existing gas infrastructure can be further utilized to avoid stranded

investments, and the actual fuel production can also be used—with some technical
limitations—for load management, which again will reduce the need for storage
technologies.

_Inter-sectorial connectivity_ involves the connection of the heating (including pro-
cess heat) and transport sectors. Neither the transport sector nor the heating sector
will undergo complete electrification. To supply industrial process heat, the capacity
of co-generation plants—operated with bio-, geothermal, or hydrogen fuels—will
be increased by a factor of 2.5 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. Co-generation heating sys-
tems with heat storage capacities and heat pumps operated with renewable electric-
ity will lead to more flexibility in the management of both load and demand.
However, an analysis of the full potential for these heating systems was not within
the scope of this project, so they have not been included in the modelling. Further
research with localized data is required.

_Resource efficiency_ In addition to energy and GHG modelling, a resource assess-

ment of selected metals has been undertaken (see Chap. [^11]:). A variety of technolo-

gies—especially storage technologies—can be used to reduce the pressure on

resource requirements, namely for cobalt and lithium for batteries and electric

mobility and the silver required for solar technologies. Therefore, the choice of stor-

age technologies has taken the specific requirements for metals into account.

```
Table 8.11 shows the storage volumes (in GWh per year) required to avoid the
```

curtailment of variable renewable power generation and the utilization of storage

capacities for batteries and pumped hydro for charging with variable renewable

electricity in the calculated scenarios. The total storage throughput, including the

hydrogen production and the amount of hydrogen-based dispatch power plants, is

also shown.

Pumped hydropower will remain the backbone of the storage concept until 2030,

when batteries start to overtake pumped hydropower by volume. The model does

not distinguish between different battery or pumped hydro technologies. Hydrogen-

based dispatch will remain the largest contributor to systems services after 2030

until the end of the modelling period.

**8.4.5 Global: Required Storage Capacities for the Stationary**
**Power Sector**

The world market for storage and dispatch technologies and services will increase
significantly in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The annual market for new hydro pump storage
plants will grow on average by 6 GW per year to a total capacity of 244 GW in

2030. During the same period, the total installed capacity for batteries will grow to
12 GW, requiring an annual market of 1 GW. Between 2030 and 2050, the energy
service sector for storage and storage technologies must accelerate further. The

battery market must grow by an annual installation rate of 22 GW, and as a result, it

will overtake the global capacity of pumped hydro between 2040 and 2050. The

conversion of the gas infrastructure from natural gas to hydrogen and synthetic fuels

will start slowly between 2020 and 2030, with the conversion of power plants with

an annual capacity of around 2 GW. However, after 2030, the transformation of the

global gas industry to hydrogen will accelerate significantly, with a total of 197 GW

of gas power plants and gas co-generation capacity converted each year. In parallel,

the average capacity factor for gas and hydrogen plants will decrease from 29%

(2578 h/year) in 2030 to 11% (975 h/year) by 2050, turning the gas sector from a

supply-driven to a service-driven industry.

At around 2030, the 1.5 °C Scenario requires more storage throughput than does

the 2.0 °C Scenario, but storage demands for the two scenarios will be equal at the

end of the modelling period. It is assumed that this higher throughput can be man-

aged with equally high installed capacities, leading to annual capacity factors for

battery and hydro pump storage of around 5–6% by 2050 (Table 8.12).

```
Table 8.13 shows the average global investment costs for the battery and hydro
```

pump storage capacities in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios. Both pathways have

equal storage capacities and cost projections, especially for batteries, but are highly

uncertain in the years beyond 2025. Therefore, the costs are only estimates and

require research.

**8.5 OECD North America**

**8.5.1 OECD North America: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.5.1.1 OECD North America: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

Combining the assumptions for population growth, GDP growth, and energy inten-

sity will result in the development pathways for OECD North America’s final energy

demand shown in Fig. 8.17 under the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Under

the 5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 10% from the

current 70,500 PJ/year to 77,800 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final

energy demand will decrease by 47% compared with current consumption and will

reach 37,300 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will

reach 33,700 PJ, 52% below the 2015 demand level. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final

energy demand in 2050 will be 10% lower than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The electric-

ity demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility)

will decrease from 4230 TWh/year in 2015 to 3340 TWh/year (2.0  °C) or 2950

TWh/year (1.5  °C) by 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C case (6050 TWh/year in

2050), the efficiency measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will save a maxi-

mum of 2710 TWh/year and 3100 TWh/year, respectively.

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. The 2.0 °C Scenario will require approximately 1400 TWh/year of electricity

for electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector, it will require

approximately 3300 TWh/year for electric mobility. The generation of hydrogen

(for transport and high-temperature process heat) and the manufacture of synthetic

fuels (mainly for transport) will add an additional power demand of 3000 TWh/year.

Therefore, the gross power demand will rise from 5300 TWh/year in 2015 to 9500

TWh/year in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario, 30% higher than in the 5.0 °C case. In the

1.5 °C Scenario, the gross electricity demand will increase to a maximum of 9400

TWh/year in 2050 for similar reasons.

The efficiency gains in the heating sector will be similar in magnitude to those in

the electricity sector. Under the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios, a final energy con-

sumption equivalent to about 7000 PJ/year and 9400 PJ/year, respectively, will be

avoided by 2050 through efficiency gains compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.5.1.2 OECD North America: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, 100% of the electricity produced in OECD

North America will come from renewable energy sources by 2050. ‘New’ renew-

ables—mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 85% of the total

electricity generated. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be

68% by 2030 and 89% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach

about 1880 GW by 2030 and 3810 GW by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the share
of renewable electricity generation in 2030 is assumed to be 84%. The 1.5  °C
Scenario projects a generation capacity from renewable energy of about 3920 GW
in 2050.
Table 8.14 shows the development of the installed capacities of different renew-
able technologies in OECD North America over time. Figure 8.18 provides an over-
view of the overall power-generation structure in OECD North America. From 2020
onwards, the continuing growth of wind and PV—to 1090 GW and 2130 GW,
respectively—is complemented by up to 210 GW of solar thermal generation, as
well as limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean energy, in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both
the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios will lead to a high proportion of variable power
generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 49% and 59%, respectively, by 2030, and 73%
and 74%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.5.1.3 OECD North America: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.19 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs
over time, including CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated electricity-
generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 4.9 ct/kWh. In the
5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when they reach 10.1 ct/
kWh. The generation costs in the 2.0 °C Scenario will increase in a similar way until
2030, when they reach 8.3 ct/kWh, and then drop to 6.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the
1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 8.8 ct/kWh and then drop to 7.1 ct/kWh by

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs in 2050 are 3.3 ct/kWh lower than
in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the generation costs in 2050 are 3.1 ct/
kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. Note that these estimates of generation costs do
not take into account integration costs such as power grid expansion, storage, or
other load-balancing measures.
Under the 5.0  °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices
will result in an increase in total electricity supply costs from today’s $270 billion/
year to more than $760 billion/year in 2050. In both alternative scenarios, the total
supply costs in 2050 will be around $690 billion/year The long-term costs for elec-
tricity supply in 2050 will be 8%–9% lower than in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result
of the estimated generation costs and the electrification of heating and mobility.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0  °C case to 7.5 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C

Scenario, they will increase until 2030, when they reach 7.3 ct/kWh, and then drop

to 6.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 8.4 ct/kWh in

2030, and then drop to 7.1 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation

costs will be, at maximum, 1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case, and this will

```

occur in 2030. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, the maxi-

mum difference in generation costs will be 2 ct/kWh in 2030. If the CO[^2]: costs are
not considered, the total electricity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will increase to

$570 billion/year in 2050.

**8.5.1.4 OECD North America: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $7600 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replace-
ment after the end of their economic lifetimes. This value is equivalent to approxi-
mately $211 billion per year on average, which is $4400 billion more than in the
5.0 °C case ($3200 billion). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, an investment of around $8180
billion for power generation will be required between 2015 and 2050. On average,
this is an investment of $227 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment
in conventional power plants will be around 48% of the total cumulative invest-
ments, whereas approximately 52% will be invested in renewable power generation
and co-generation (Fig. 8.20). However, under the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, OECD
North America will shift almost 93% (93%) of its entire investment to renewables
and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil fuel share of the power sector investment will
mainly focus on gas power plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $3240 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $90 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be

equivalent to 70% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C

Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $3910 billion,

or $109 billion per year.

**8.5.1.5 OECD North America: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increases in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 32%,

from 19,700 PJ/year in 2015 to 26,000 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures

will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 27% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C

Scenario relative to the 5.0  °C case, and by 36% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Today,

renewables supply around 11% of OECD North America’s final energy demand for

heating, with the main contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide

38% of OECD North America’s total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario

and 61% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of

the total heat demand in 2050.

```
Figure 8.21 shows the development of different technologies for heating in
```

OECD North America over time, and Table 8.15 provides the resulting renewable

heat supply for all scenarios. Until 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor.

The growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead, in the long

term, to a biomass share of 25% under the 2.0  °C Scenario and 19% under the

1.5 °C Scenario. Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence

on fossil fuels under both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around

direct use of electricity for heating will also increase by a factor of 4.6–4.9 between
2015 and 2050 and will have a final energy share of 21% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and 26% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.5.1.6 OECD North America: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050
will amount to around $2580 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments
for plant replacement after their economic lifetimes) or approximately $72 billion

per year. The largest share of investment in OECD North America is assumed to be

for heat pumps (around $1300 billion), followed by solar collectors and biomass

technologies. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable

technologies, resulting in a lower average annual investment of around $78 billion

per year (Table 8.16, Fig. 8.22).

**8.5.1.7 OECD North America: Transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in OECD North America is expected to

decrease by 8% in the 5.0  °C Scenario, from around 31,000 PJ/year in 2015 to

28,600 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and

behavioural changes will save 73% (20,970 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the

5.0 °C case. Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in trans-

port demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario, of 74%

(or 21,100 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.17, Fig. 8.23).

By 2030, electricity will provide 11% (620 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s

total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and in 2050, the share will be 44% (930

TWh/year). In 2050, up to 2090 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the transport

sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the annual

electricity demand will be 1030 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a

hydrogen demand of 2020 PJ/year by 2050.

Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 2540 PJ/year

Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-

duced, with a maximum amount of 270 PJ/year in 2050. Because the reduction in

fossil fuel for transport will be faster, biofuel use will increase in the 1.5 °C Scenario
to a maximum of 5900 PJ/year. The demand for synthetic fuels will decrease to zero
by 2050  in the 1.5  °C Scenario because of the lower overall energy demand by
transport.

**8.5.1.8 OECD North America: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, OECD North America’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will decrease
by 9% from 6170 Mt. in 2015 to 5612 Mt. in 2050. Stringent mitigation measures
in both the alternative scenarios will lead to reductions in annual emissions to 930
Mt. in 2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 120 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with fur-
ther reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emis-
sions from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 216 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0  °C and
1.5 °C Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will
be 99 Gt and 72 Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 54% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 67% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
decrease in the annual emissions will occur under both alternative scenarios. In the
2.0 °C Scenario, the reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by
the ‘Transport’ and ‘Residential and other’ sectors (Fig. 8.24).

**8.5.1.9 OECD North America: Primary Energy Consumption**

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the levels of primary energy
consumption under the three scenarios are shown in Fig. 8.25. In the 2.0 °C Scenario,
the primary energy demand will decrease by 46%, from around 111,600 PJ/year in
2015 to 60,600 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario, the overall
primary energy demand will decrease by 50% by 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario
(5.0 °C: 121,000 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand
will be even lower (56,600 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conver-
sion losses will be lower.
Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. As a
result, renewable energy will have a primary energy share of 34% in 2030 and 91%
in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a pri-

mary share of more than 91% in 2050 (including non-energy consumption, which
will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out by 2040 under both
the 2.0 °C and the 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy consumption
of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 1290 EJ, the cumulative coal con-
sumption to about 470 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 1300 EJ. In contrast, in
the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 730 EJ, the cumula-
tive coal demand to 120 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 640 EJ. Even lower
cumulative fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 480 EJ for natural
gas, 80 EJ for coal, and 440 EJ for oil.

**8.5.2 Regional Results: Power Sector Analysis**

The key results for all 10 world regions and their sub-regions are presented in this
section, with standardized tables to make them comparable for the reader. Regional
differences and particularities are summarized. It is important to note that the elec-
tricity loads for the sub-regions—which are in several cases also countries—are
calculated (see Chap. [^3]:) and are not real measured values. When information was
available, the model results are compared with published peak loads and adapted as
far as possible. However, deviations of 10% or more for the base year are in the
range of the probability. The interconnection capacities between sub-regions are
simplified assumptions based on current practices in liberalized power markets, and
include cross-border trade (e.g., between Canada and the USA) (C2ES [^2017]:) or

within the European Union (EU). The EU set a target of 10% interconnection capac-

ity between their member states in 2002 (EU-EG [^2017]:). The interconnection capac-

ities for sub-regions that are not geographically connected are set to zero for the

entire modelling period, even when there is current discussion about the implemen-

tation of new interconnections, such as for the ASEAN Power Grid (ASEAN-CE

[^2018]:).

**8.5.3 OECD North America: Power Sector Analysis**

The OECD North America region includes Canada, the USA, and Mexico, and

therefore contains more than one large electricity market. Although the power sec-

tor is liberalized in all three countries, the state of implementation and the market

rules in place vary significantly. Even within the USA, each state has different mar-

ket rules and grid regulations. Therefore, the calculated scenarios assume the prior-

ity dispatch of all renewables and priority grid connections for new renewable

power plants, and a streamlined process for required construction permits. The

power sector analysis for all regions is based on technical, not political,

considerations.

**8.5.3.1 OECD North America: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The size of the renewable power market in OECD North America will increase

significantly in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The annual market for solar PV must increase

from 22.76 GW in 2020 by a factor of 5 to an average of 95 GW by 2030. The

onshore wind market must expand to 35 GW by 2025, an increase from around 13

GW 5  years earlier. By 2050, offshore wind generation will increase to 9.7 GW

annually, by a factor of 7 compared with the base year (2015). Concentrated solar

power plants will play an important role in dispatchable solar electricity generation

to supply bulk power, especially for industry and industrial process heat. The annual

market in 2030 will increase to 16 GW, compared with 1.7 GW in 2020. The 1.5 °C

Scenario accelerates both the phase-out of fossil-fuel-based power generation and

the deployment of renewables—mainly solar PV and wind in the first decade—

about 5–7 years faster than the 2.0 °C Scenario (Table 8.18).

**8.5.3.2 OECD North America: Utilization of Power-Generation**

**Capacities**

Table 8.19 shows the increasing shares of variable renewable power generation

across all North American regions. Whereas Alaska and Canada are dominated by

variable wind power generation, Mexico and the sunny mid-west of the USA have

significant contributions from CSP. Solar PV is distributed evenly across the entire

region. Onshore and offshore wind penetration is highest in rural areas, whereas

solar roof-top power generation is highest in suburban regions where roof space and

electricity demand from residential buildings correlate best. The south-west of the

USA will have the highest share of variable renewables—mainly solar PV for resid-

ual homes and office buildings, connected to battery systems. There are no struc-

tural differences between the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios, except faster

implementation in the latter. It is assumed that all regions will have an interconnec-

tion capacity of 20% of the regional average load, with which to exchange renew-

able and dispatch electricity to neighbouring regions.

```
Capacity factors for the five generation types and the resulting average utiliza-
```

tion are shown in Table 8.20. Compared with the global average, North America

will start with a capacity factor for limited dispatchable generation of about 10%

over the global average. By 2050, the average capacity factor across all power-

generation types will be 29% for both scenarios. A low average capacity factor

requires flexible power plants and a power market framework that incentivizes

them.

**8.5.3.3 OECD North America: Development of Load, Generation,**

**and Residual Load**

Table 8.21 shows the development of the maximum load, generation, and resulting

residual load (the load remaining after variable renewable generation). With

increased shares of variable solar PV and wind power, the minimum residual load

can become negative. If this happens, the surplus generation can either be exported

to other regions, stored, or curtailed. The export of load to other regions requires

transmission lines. If the theoretical utilization rate of transmission cables (= inter-

connection) exceeds 100%, the transport capacity must be increased. We assume

that the entire load need not be exported, and that surplus generation capacities can

be curtailed because interconnections are costly and require a certain level of utili-

zation to make them economically viable. An analysis of the economic viability of

new interconnections and their optimal transmission capacities is beyond the scope

of this research project.

```
In Alaska in the 2.0 °C Scenario, for example, generation and demand are bal-
```

anced in 2020 and 2030, but peak generation is substantially higher than demand in

2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, a significant level of overproduction is achieved by
2030. In the two scenarios, the surplus peak generation is equally high. These results

have been calculated under the assumption that surplus generation will be stored in

a cascade of batteries and pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) or used to pro-

duce hydrogen and/or synthetic fuels. Therefore, the maximal interconnection

requirements shown in this chapter represent the maximum surplus generation

capacity. To avoid curtailment, these overcapacities have mainly been used for

hydrogen production. Therefore, Alaska could remain an energy exporter but switch

from oil to wind-generated synthetic gas and/or hydrogen.

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

each production peak would require significant additional investment. Therefore, it

is assumed that not all surplus solar and wind generation must be stored, and that up

to 5% (in 2030) and 10% (in 2050) of the annual production can be curtailed with-

out significant economic disadvantage. We assume that regions with favourable

wind and solar potentials, and advantages regarding available space, will use their

overcapacities to export electricity via transmission lines and/or to produce syn-

thetic and/or hydrogen fuels.

The southern part of the USA will achieve a significant solar PV share by 2050

and storage demand will be highest in this region. Storage and dispatch demand will

increase in all sub-regions between 2025 and 2035. Before 2025, storage demand

will be zero in all regions.

**8.6 Latin America**

**8.6.1 Latin America: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.6.1.1 Latin America: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

Combining the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy inten-

sity will produce the future development pathways for Latin America’s final energy

demand shown in Fig. 8.26 for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Under the

5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 70% from the cur-

rent 19,200 PJ/year to 32,600 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the final

energy demand will decrease by 11% compared with current consumption and will

reach 17,000 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will

fall to 15,800 PJ in 2050, 18% below the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the

final energy demand in 2050 will be 7% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario. The

electricity demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or

e-mobility) will increase from 740 TWh/year in 2015 to around 1560 TWh/year in

2050 in both alternative scenarios, around 300 TWh/year lower than in the 5.0 °C

Scenario (1860 TWh/year in 2050).

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be about 600

TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector an

increase of approximately 1700 TWh/year will be caused by electric mobility. The

generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process heat) and the

manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an additional power

demand of 600 TWh/year. The gross power demand will thus increase from 1300

TWh/year in 2015 to 3500 TWh/year in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario, 25% higher

than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the gross electricity demand will

increase to a maximum of 3800 TWh/year in 2050.

Efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the electricity

sector. Under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 4300 PJ/year will be avoided through efficiency gains in both scenarios

by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.6.1.2 Latin America: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power coming from

renewable sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in Latin America will

come from renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—

mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 63% of the total elec-

tricity generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 87%

by 2030 and 96% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about

530 GW by 2030 and 1030 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity genera-

tion in 2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario will be 91%. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the genera-

tion capacity from renewable energy will be approximately 1210 GW in 2050.

America over time. Figure  8.27 provides an overview of the overall power-

generation structure in Latin America. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth

of wind and PV, up to 230 GW and 410 GW, respectively, will be complemented by

up to 60 GW solar thermal generation, as well as limited biomass, geothermal, and

ocean energy, in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will lead
to a high proportion of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 31% and
39%, respectively, by 2030, and 52% and 57%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.6.1.3 Latin America: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.28 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs
over time, including CO[^2]: emission costs, under all scenarios. The calculated
electricity-generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 4.5 ct/kWh.

In the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when they reach 8.3

ct/kWh. The generation costs in the 2.0 °C Scenario will increase until 2030, when

they reach 7 ct/kWh, and will then drop to 5.9 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5  °C

Scenario, they will increase to 6.7 ct/kWh, and then drop to 5.6 ct/kWh by 2050. In

the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs in 2050 will be 2.4 ct/kWh lower than in

the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the maximum difference in generation costs

will be 2.6 ct/kWh in 2050. Note that these estimates of generation costs do not take

into account integration costs such as power grid expansion, storage, or other load-

balancing measures.

In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will

result in an increase in total electricity supply costs from today’s $70 billion/year to

more than $240 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs

will be $230 billion/year and in the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will be $240 billion/year

in 2050. The long-term costs for electricity supply will be more than 5% lower in

the 2.0 °C Scenario than in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result of the estimated genera-
tion costs and the electrification of heating and mobility. Further electrification and
synthetic fuel generation in the 1.5 °C Scenario will result in total power generation
costs that are similar to the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0  °C case to 7.1 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C

Scenario, they will increase until 2030, when they will reach 6.6 ct/kWh, and then

drop to 5.9 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 6.5 ct/kWh

and then drop to 5.6 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs

will be maximum, at 0.25 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case, in 2030 (0.1 ct/

kWh in the 1.5 °C Scenario). The generation costs in 2050 will again be lower in the

alternative scenarios than in the 5.0 °C case: 1.2 ct/kWh in the 2.0 °C Scenario and

1.5 ct/kWh in the 1.5 °C Scenario. If CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total electric-
ity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will increase to about $210 billion/year in 2050.

**8.6.1.4 Latin America: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of about $1920 billion will be required for power generation between
2015 and 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario, including additional power plants for the
production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replacement
after the ends of their economic lives. This value is equivalent to approximately $53
billion per year, on average, which is $880 billion more than in the 5.0  °C case
($1040 billion). An investment of around $2190 billion for power generation will be
required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average, this will be an
investment of $61 billion per year. Under the 5.0  °C Scenario, the investment in
conventional power plants will be around 25% of the total cumulative investments,
whereas approximately 75% will be invested in renewable power generation and
co-generation (Fig. 8.29).
However, under the 2.0  °C (1.5  °C) Scenario, Latin America will shift almost
94% (95%) of its entire investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the
fossil fuel share of the power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas
power plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $820 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $23 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 90% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $900 billion,
or $25 billion per year.

**8.6.1.5 Latin America: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0  °C Scenario by 72%,

from 7800 PJ/year in 2015 to 13,300 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

Scenarios, energy efficiency measures will help to reduce the energy demand for heat-

ing by 32% in 2050, relative to that in the 5.0 °C Scenario. Today, renewables supply

around 42% of Latin America’s final energy demand for heating, with the main con-

tribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 68% of Latin America’s total

heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 75% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both

scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.

```
Figure 8.30 shows the development of different technologies for heating in Latin
```

America over time, and Table 8.24 provides the resulting renewable heat supply for

all scenarios. Biomass will remain the main contributor. The growing use of solar,

geothermal, and environmental heat will supplement mainly fossil fuels. This will

lead in the long term to a biomass share of 65% under the 2.0 °C Scenario and 50%

under the 1.5 °C Scenario.

### Fig. 8.30 Latin America: development of heat supply by energy carrier in the scenarios

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels
in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 200 PJ/year in the
2.0 °C Scenario and 400 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of electricity
for heating will also increase by a factor of 2–4 between 2015 and 2050 and will
attain a final energy share of 20% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 39% in the
1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.6.1.6 Latin America: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050
will amount to around $580 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments in
plant replacement after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $16 billion per
year. The largest share of investment in Latin America is assumed to be for solar
collectors (more than $200 billion), followed by biomass technologies and heat
pumps. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable tech-
nologies, but due to the lower heat demand, the average annual investment will
again be around $16 billion per year (Fig. 8.31, Table 8.25).

**8.6.1.7 Latin America: Transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in Latin America is expected to increase by
63% under the 5.0 °C Scenario, from around 7100 PJ/year in 2015 to 11,700 PJ/year
in 2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural
changes will save 69% (8090 PJ/year) by 2050 relative to the 5.0  °C Scenario.
Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in transport demand
will lead to even greater energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 77% (or 9040 PJ/
year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.26, Fig. 8.32).
By 2030, electricity will provide 6% (110 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand under the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be
47% (470 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 480 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the
transport sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the
annual electricity demand will be 390 TWh in 2050. The 1.5  °C Scenario also
assumes a hydrogen demand of 430 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 1340 PJ/year
Around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be introduced, with a
maximum of 190 PJ/year by 2050. Due to the lower overall energy demand in trans-
port, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a maximum of 1030 PJ/
year The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to 350 PJ/year.

**8.6.1.8 Latin America: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, Latin America’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by 48%,
from 1220 Mt. in 2015 to 1806 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures in

both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 240 Mt. in

2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 50 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further reduc-
tions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions from
2015 until 2050 will add up to 56 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios,
the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 21 Gt and 17
Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 63% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 70% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by the
‘Residential and other’ and ‘Industry’ sectors (Fig. 8.33).

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

240

**8.6.1.9 Latin America: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption under the three scenarios when the
assumptions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.34. In the
2.0  °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 2%, from around
28,400 PJ/year in 2015 to 27,900 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C
Scenario, the overall primary energy demand will decrease by 38% in 2050 in the
2.0  °C Scenario (5.0  °C: 45000 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the primary
energy demand will be even lower (25,700 PJ in 2050) because the final energy
demand and conversion losses will be lower.
Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This
will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 55% in 2030 and
94% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will also
have a primary energy share of more than 94% in 2050 (including non-energy con-
sumption, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out
by 2035 under both the 2.0 °C and the 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary
energy consumption of natural gas in the 5.0  °C case will add up to 290 EJ, the
cumulative coal consumption to about 60 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 460
EJ. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to
130 EJ, the cumulative coal demand to 20 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 200

**8.6.2 Latin America: Power Sector Analysis**

The Latin American region is extremely diverse. It borders Mexico in the north and

its southern tip is in the South Pacific. It also includes all the Caribbean islands and

Central America. The power-generation situation is equally diverse, and the sub-

regional breakdown tries to reflect this diversity to some extent. In the Caribbean,

which contains 28 island nations and more than 7000 islands, the calculated storage

demand will almost certainly be higher than the region’s average, because a regional

power exchange grid between the islands seems impractical. To calculate the

detailed storage demand, island-specific analyses would be required, as has recently

been done for Barbados (Hohmeyer [^2015]:). The mainland of South America has

been subdivided into the large economic centres of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, and

Central America and the northern part of South America have been clustered into

two parts.

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

242

**8.6.2.1 Latin America: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The most important future renewable technologies for Latin America are solar PV

and onshore wind, followed by CSP (which will be especially suited to the Atacama

Desert in Chile) and offshore wind, mainly in the coastal areas of Brazil and

Argentina. The annual market for solar PV must increase from 6.5 GW in 2020 by

a factor of three to an average of 15.5 GW by 2030 under the 2.0 °C Scenario and

to around 23 GW under the 1.5 °C Scenario. The onshore wind market in the 1.5 °C

Scenario must increase to 15 GW by 2025, compared with the average annual

onshore wind market of around 3 GW between 2014 and 2017 (GWEC [^2018]:). By

2050, offshore wind will have increased to a moderate annual new installation

capacity of around 2–3 GW from 2025 to 2050  in both scenarios. Concentrated

solar power plants will be limited to the desert regions of South America, especially

Chile. The market for biofuels for electricity generation will play an important role

in all agricultural areas, including the Caribbean and Central America, where most

geothermal resources are located (Table 8.27).

**8.6.2.2 Latin America: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

Table 8.28 shows that our modelling assumes that for the entire modelling period,

there will be no interconnection capacity between the Caribbean, Central America,

and South America, whereas the interconnection capacity in the rest of South

America will increase to 15% by 2030 and to 20% by 2050. The shares of variable

renewables are almost identical in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The lowest rates

of variable renewables are in central South America and Central America because

the onshore wind potential is limited by average wind speeds that are lower than

elsewhere. Compared with all the other world regions, Latin America has the high-

est share of dispatchable renewables, mainly attributable to existing hydropower

plants.

Compared with other regions of the world, Latin America currently has a small

fleet of coal and nuclear power plants, but they are operated with a high capacity

factor (Table 8.29). The dispatch order for all world regions in all cases is assumed

to be the same, to make the results comparable. Therefore, the capacity factors of

these dispatch power plants (mainly gas) will increase at the expense of those for

coal and nuclear power plants, which explains the rapid reduction in the capacity

factor in 2020. Therefore, this effect is the result of the assumed dispatch order,

rather than of an increase in variable power generation.

**8.6.2.3 Latin America: Development of Load, Generation**

**and Residual Load**

The sub-regions of Latin America are highly diverse in their geographic features

and population densities, so the maximum loads in the different sub-regions vary

widely. Table 8.30 shows that the sub-region with the smallest calculated maximum

load is Uruguay, with only 2.3 GW, which seems realistic because the maximum

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

load was 1.7 GW in 2012 according to IDB ([^2013]:). Brazil, Uruguay’s direct neigh-

bour, has the largest load of close to 100 GW, which will increase by a factor of 2.5

to around 250 GW by 2050 under both scenarios. Brazil’s maximum generation will

increase accordingly, without significant overproduction peaks. The calculated

maximum increase in interconnection required is only 10 GW. In Argentina, peak

generation matches peak demand because Argentina has one of the best wind

resources in the world in Patagonia. Surplus wind power can either be exported after

a significant increase in transmission capacity or, as assumed in our scenario, it can

be used to produce synthetic and hydrogen fuels.

```
Table 8.31 provides an overview of the calculated storage and dispatch power
```

requirements by sub-region. As indicated in the introduction to the Latin America

results, the storage requirements for the Caribbean might be high because the region

cannot exchange solar or wind electricity with other sub-regions. However, all other

sub-regions contain either several countries or larger provinces, so they are more

suited to the integration of variable electricity. Compared with other world regions,

Latin America has one of the lowest storage capacities and one of the lowest needs

for additional dispatch. This is because the region’s installed capacity of hydro-

power is high. However, this research does not include a water resource assessment

for hydropower plants. Droughts may increase the demand for storage and/or hydro-

gen dispatch.

**8.7 OECD Europe**

**8.7.1 OECD Europe: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.7.1.1 OECD Europe: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

Combining the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy inten-

sity produces the future development pathways for OECD Europe’s final energy

demand shown in Fig. 8.35 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the

5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 9%, from the current

46,000 PJ/year to 50,000 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy

demand will decrease by 39% compared with current consumption and will reach

28,000 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will reach

25,200 PJ, 45% below the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final energy

demand in 2050 will be 10% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario. The electricity

demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will

decrease from 2300 TWh/year in 2015 to 2040 TWh/year by 2050 in both alterna-

tive scenarios. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (3200 TWh/year in 2050), the effi-

ciency measures implemented in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios will save 1160

TWh/year in 2050.

**Fig. 8.35** OECD Europe: development in three scenarios

Electrification will cause a significant increase in the electricity demand by 2050.

In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will increase to approxi-

mately 1300 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport

sector, the demand will increase to approximately 2600 TWh/year in response to

increased electric mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-

temperature process heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for trans-

port) will add an additional power demand of 1600 TWh/year The gross power

demand will thus rise from 3600 TWh/year in 2015 to 6000 TWh/year by 2050 in

the 2.0 °C Scenario, 28% higher than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the

gross electricity demand will increase to a maximum of 6400 TWh/year by 2050.

Efficiency gains could be even larger in the heating sector than in the electricity

sector. Under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 6200 PJ/year and 8200 PJ/year, respectively, are avoided by efficiency

gains by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.7.1.2 OECD Europe: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in OECD Europe will come

from renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—mainly

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

252

wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 75% of the total electricity
generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 68% by
2030 and 89% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 1200
GW by 2030 and 2270 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity generation
in 2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario is assumed to be 74%. The 1.5 °C Scenario will have
a generation capacity from renewable energy of approximately 2480 GW in 2050.
Table 8.32 shows the development of different renewable technologies in OECD
Europe over time. Figure 8.36 provides an overview of the overall power-generation
structure in OECD Europe. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and
PV, up to 790 GW and 1000 GW, respectively, will be complemented by generation
from biomass (ca. 110 GW) CSP and ocean energy (more than 50 GW each), in the
2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will lead to high proportions
of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 38% and 45%, respectively,
by 2030 and 67% and 68%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.7.1.3 OECD Europe: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.37 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs
over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated elec-
tricity generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 7 ct/kWh. In the
5.0 °C case, generation costs will increase until 2050, when they will reach 10.4 ct/

kWh. The generation costs in both alternative scenarios will increase until 2030,
when they will reach 10.3 ct/kWh, and they will drop by 2050 to 8.9 ct/kWh and 8.8
ct/kWh, respectively, 1.5–1.6 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. Note that these
estimates of generation costs do not take into account integration costs such as
power grid expansion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
result in an increase in total electricity supply costs from today’s $270 billion/year
to more than $550 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs
will be $560 billion/year and in the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will be $590 billion/year
The long-term costs for electricity supply will be more than 2% higher in the 2.0 °C
Scenario than in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and
the electrification of heating and mobility. Further electrification and synthetic fuel
generation in the 1.5 °C Scenario will result in total power generation costs that are
8% higher than in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario to 8.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, they will increase until 2030 when they reach 9.5 ct/kWh, and then

drop to 8.9 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 9.7 ct/kWh,

and then drop to 8.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs

will reach a maximum of 1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case in 2030. In the

1.5  °C Scenario, the maximum difference in generation costs compared with the

5.0 °C Scenario will be 1.2 ct/kWh, which will occur in 2040. If the CO[^2]: costs are
not considered, the total electricity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will rise to about

$470 billion/year in 2050.

**8.7.1.4 OECD Europe: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $4900 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments to replace plants
at the ends of their economic lives. This value is equivalent to approximately $136
billion per year on average, which is $2150 billion more than in the 5.0  °C case
($2750 billion). An investment of around $5340 billion for power generation will be
required between 2015 and 2050 under the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average, this will be
an investment of $148 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, investment in conven-
tional power plants will be around 26% of the total cumulative investments, whereas
approximately 74% will be invested in renewable power generation and co-
generation (Fig. 8.38).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, OECD Europe will shift almost 96%
(97%) of its entire investments to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil
fuel share of the power sector investments will predominantly focus on gas power
plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $2340 billion in 2050,

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```
255
```

equivalent to $65 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 110% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $2600 billion,
or $72 billion per year.

**8.7.1.5 OECD Europe: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 16%,
from 20,600 PJ/year in 2015 to 24,000 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 26% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario relative to that in the 5.0  °C case, and by 34% in the 1.5  °C Scenario.
Today, renewables supply around 19% of OECD Europe’s final energy demand for
heating, with the main contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide
44% of OECD Europe’s total heat demand in 2030 under the 2.0 °C Scenario and
53% under the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of
the total heat demand in 2050.

Figure 8.39 shows the development of different technologies for heating in
```

OECD Europe over time, and Table 8.33 provides the resulting renewable heat sup-

ply for all scenarios. Up to 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor. The

growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead in the long term

to a biomass share of 27% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 28% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels

in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 1900 PJ/year in

the 2.0 °C Scenario and 2200 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of elec-

tricity for heating will also increase by a factor of 1.5–1.6 between 2015 and 2050,

and will have a final energy share of 22% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 23%

in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.7.1.6 OECD Europe: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $2410 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments

for plant replacement at the ends of their economic lifetimes), or approximately $67

billion per year. The largest share of investments in OECD Europe is assumed to be

for heat pumps (around $1200 billion), followed by solar collectors ($1080 billion).

The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technologies.

However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0 °C Scenario) will results

in a lower average annual investment of around $51 billion per year (Fig. 8.40,

Table 8.34).

**8.7.1.7 OECD Europe: Transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in OECD Europe is expected to decrease by
3% in the 5.0 °C Scenario, from around 14,000 PJ/year in 2015 to 13,600 PJ/year in

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes
will save 69% (9460 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario. Additional
modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the transport demand will lead
to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 76% (or 10,300 PJ/year) in
2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.35, Fig. 8.41).
By 2030, electricity will provide 18% (430 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 64%
(740 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 840 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-
port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand will be 580 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a
hydrogen demand of 730 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 600  PJ/year
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-
duced, with a maximum amount of 130 PJ/year in 2050. Biofuel use will be reduced
in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a maximum of 590 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel
demand will reach 170 PJ/year.

**8.7.1.8 OECD Europe: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, OECD Europe’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 15%
from 3400 Mt. in 2015 to 2876 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures in

both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 570 Mt. in

2040  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and to 270 Mt. in the 1.5  °C Scenario, with further
reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 116 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C
Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 55
Gt and 44 Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 53% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 62% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in the annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the
2.0 °C Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by
the ‘Transport’ and the ‘Residential and other’ sectors (Fig. 8.42).

**8.7.1.9 OECD Europe: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-
tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.43. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 44%, from around 71,200
PJ/year in 2015 to 40,100 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, the
overall primary energy demand will decrease by 43% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario
(5.0 °C: 70,700 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will
be even lower (39,000 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conversion
losses will be lower.
Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This
will cause renewable energy to have primary energy shares of 39% in 2030 and 92%
in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a pri-
mary energy share of more than 92% in 2050 (including non-energy consumption,
which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out by 2040
under both the 2.0  °C and the 1.5  °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy
consumption of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 670 EJ, the cumulative
coal consumption to about 300 EJm, and the crude oil consumption to 660 EJ. In
contrast, in the 2.0 °C case, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 420 EJ, the
cumulative coal demand to 100 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 320 EJ. Even
lower fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 340 EJ for natural gas,
70 EJ for coal, and 240 EJ for oil.

**8.7.2 OECD Europe: Power Sector Analysis**

The European power sector is liberalized across the EU and cross-border trade in

electricity has a long tradition and is very well documented. The European Network

of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) publishes detailed

data about the annual cross-border trade (ENTSO-E [^2018]:) and produces the _Ten-_

_Year-Network Development Plan (TYNDP)_, which aims to integrate 60% renewable

electricity by 2040 (TYNDP [^2016]:). While the extent to which the power sector is

liberalised and open for competition for generation and supply varies significantly

across the EU, at the time of the writing of this book all 28-member states had

renewable electricity and energy efficiency targets and policies to implement them.

However, the OECD Europe region covers not only the EU but also neighbouring

countries such as Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, which are not members of the

EU, but are connected to the EU grid and are also involved in the cross-border elec-

tricity trade. The region also includes Iceland, Malta, and a significant number of

islands in the coastal waters of the European continent and the Mediterranean Sea.

The storage demand for all the islands and island nations cannot be calculated with

a regional approach, and doing so was beyond the scope of this research. Israel is

also part of OECD Europe in the IEA world regions used for this analysis. However,

because of its geographic position, and to reflect current and possible future inter-

connections with its neighbours, Israel has been taken out of the energy balance of

OECD Europe and integrated into the Middle East region.

**8.7.2.1 OECD Europe: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The annual market for solar PV must increase from 11 GW in 2020 by a factor of 2

to an average of 40 GW by 2030. The onshore wind market must expand to 18 GW

by 2025 under the 2.0  °C Scenario. This is only a minor increase on the average

European wind market of 10–14 GW between 2009 and 2016 and 16.8 GW in 2017.

However, the 1.5  °C Scenario requires that the size of the onshore wind market

double between 2020 and 2025. The offshore wind market for both scenarios is

similar and must increase from 3 GW (GWEC [^2018]:) in 2017 to around 10 GW per

year throughout the entire modelling period until 2050. All European lignite power

plants will have stopped operations by 2035, and the last hard coal power plant will

have gone offline by 2040 under the 2.0 °C Scenario. The 1.5 °C pathway requires

the phase-out 5 years earlier (Table 8.36).

**8.7.2.2 OECD Europe: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

The UK, Ireland, and the Iberian Peninsula are the least interconnected sub-regions

of OECD Europe, and they already have relatively high shares of variable renew-

ables, as shown in Table 8.37.

```
Table 8.37 shows that the Nordic countries, especially Norway and Sweden, have
```

very high shares of hydropower, including pumped hydropower. Therefore, an

increased interconnection capacity with other sub-regions by 2030 will contribute

to the integration of larger shares of wind and solar in other European regions.

Across the EU, it is assumed that the average interconnection capacities will increase

to 20% of the regional peak load.

Both alternative scenarios assume that limited dispatchable power generation—

namely coal, lignite, and nuclear—will not have priority dispatch and will be last in

the dispatch queue. Therefore, the average calculated capacity factor will decrease

from 57.5% in 2015 to only 14% in 2020, as shown in Table 8.38.

```
Table 8.38 shows that by 2020, most of the installed coal and nuclear capacity
```

will not be required to secure power supply. Instead, dispatchable renewable power

plants will fill the gap and their capacity factors will increase.

**8.7.2.3 OECD Europe: Development of Load, Generation,**

**and Residual Load**

The loads of the European sub-regions will not increase until 2030 in the two alter-

native scenarios, as shown in Table 8.39. The only exception is Turkey, which will

have a constantly increasing load. This is attributed to Turkey’s assumed economic

development and increasing per capita electricity demand, which is currently lower

than in most EU countries (WB-DB [^2018]:). The calculated load will increase in all

sub-regions between 2030 and 2050 due to the increased deployment of electric

mobility. Central Europe has a very high requirement for increased transmission

interconnection—or storage, see Table 8.40—because of increases in variable gen-

eration, including offshore wind in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Central Europe,

the Iberian Peninsula, and the UK have the highest storage demands, as shown in
Table 8.40. This corresponds to the calculated results for increased interconnec-
tions. To avoid curtailment, renewably produced hydrogen will be used to store
surplus generation for dispatch when required. Finding the optimal mix of battery
capacity, pumped hydro capacity, hydrogen production, and expansion of transmis-
sion capacity was beyond the scope of this analysis, and further research is required
on this issue.

The development pathways for Africa’s final energy demand when the assumptions
on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are combined are shown in
Fig. 8.44 for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the total
final energy demand will increase by 103% from the current 23,200 PJ/year to 47,100
PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy demand will increase at a
much slower rate, by 39% compared with current consumption, and will reach

32,300 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand under the 1.5  °C Scenario will

reach 30,100 PJ, 30% above the 2015 demand level. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final

energy demand in 2050 will be 7% lower than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The electricity

demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will

increase from 540 TWh/year in 2015 to around 2590 TWh/year in 2050 in both alter-

native scenarios, which will be 590 TWh/year higher than in the 5.0 °C case. Although

efficiency measures will reduce the specific energy consumption by appliances, the

scenarios consider higher consumption to achieve higher living standards.

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will increase to

approximately 1200 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the

transport sector, the demand will increase to approximately 1300 TWh/year in

response to increased electric mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport

and high-temperature process heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly

for transport) will add an additional power demand of 1100 TWh/year The gross

power demand will thus increase from 800 TWh/year in 2015 to 5700 TWh/year in

2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario, 119% higher than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C

Scenario, the gross electricity demand will increase to a maximum of 6300 TWh/

year in 2050.

```
The efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the elec-
```

tricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 3600 PJ/year is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared

with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.8.1.2 Africa: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in Africa will come from

renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—mainly wind,

solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 92% of the total electricity genera-

tion. Renewable electricity’s share of total production will be 61% by 2030 and 96%

by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 360 GW by 2030 and

2040 GW by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the share of renewable electricity genera-

tion in 2030 is assumed to be 73%. The 1.5  °C Scenario will have a generation

capacity from renewable energy of approximately 2280 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.41 shows the development of different renewable technologies in Africa
```

over time. Figure 8.45 provides an overview of the overall power-generation struc-

ture in Africa. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and PV, up to 610

GW and 980 GW, respectively, will be complemented by up to 230 GW of solar

thermal generation, as well as limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean energy, in the

2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will lead to high proportions

of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 40% and 49%, respectively,

by 2030, and 71% by 2050.

**8.8.1.3 Africa: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.46 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs
over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated
electricity-generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 5.4 ct/kWh.
In the 5.0 °C case, generation costs will increase until 2030, when they reach 11 ct/
kWh, and will then stabilize at 10.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C
Scenarios, the generation costs will increase until 2030, when they reach 8.4 ct/kWh
and 8.2 ct/kWh, respectively. They will then drop to 5.6 ct/kWh by 2050  in both
scenarios, 5.2 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0  °C case. Note that these estimates of
generation costs do not take into account integration costs such as power grid expan-
sion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to increase from today’s $40 billion/year to
more than $290 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs
will be $350 billion/year, and in the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will be $380 billion/year
The long-term costs of electricity supply will be more than 23% higher under the
2.0 °C Scenario than under the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result of the estimated genera-
tion costs and the electrification of heating and mobility. Further electrification and
synthetic fuel generation in the 1.5 °C Scenario will result in total power generation
costs that are 34% higher than in the 5.0 °C case.

Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0  °C case to 8.1 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C

Scenario, they will increase until 2030, when they reach 6.8 ct/kWh, and then drop

to 5.6 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 7.2 ct/kWh and

then drop to 5.6 ct/kWh by 2050. Therefore, the generation costs in both alternative

scenarios are, at maximum, 2.5 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0  °C case. If the CO2
costs are not considered, the total electricity supply costs in the 5.0  °C case will

increase to about $220 billion/year in 2050.

**8.8.1.4 Africa: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $3500 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replace-
ment at the ends of their economic lives. This value is equivalent to approximately
$97 billion per year, on average, and is $2590 billion more than in the 5.0 ° C case
($910 billion). An investment of around $3910 billion for power generation will be
required between 2015 and 2050  in the 1.5  °C Scenario. On average, this is an
investment of $109 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment in con-
ventional power plants will be around 45% of the total cumulative investments, and
approximately 55% will be invested in renewable power generation and co-genera-
tion (Fig. 8.47).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, Africa will shift almost 93% (94%) of
its entire investments to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil fuel
share of power sector investments will focus predominantly on gas power plants
that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $1510 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $42 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 60% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $1610 billion,
or $45 billion per year.

**8.8.1.5 Africa: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 166%,
from 7600 PJ/year in 2015 to 20,200 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 18% in 2050 in both alterna-
tive scenarios, relative to the 5.0 °C case. Today, renewables supply around 61% of
Africa’s final energy demand for heating, with the main contribution from biomass.
Renewable energy will provide 71% of Africa’s total heat demand in 2030 under the
2.0 °C Scenario and 79% under the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios, renewables
will provide 100% of the total heat demand from renewable energy in 2050.

```
Figure 8.48 shows the development of different technologies for heating in
```

Africa over time, and Table 8.42 provides the resulting renewable heat supply for all

scenarios. Biomass will remain the main contributor. The growing use of solar, geo-

thermal, and environmental heat will lead, in the long term, to a reduced biomass

share of 51% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 40% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels

in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 720 PJ/year in

both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of electricity for heat-

ing will also increase by a factor of 21–34 between 2015 and 2050, and will attain a

final energy share of 23% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and 37% in the 1.5  °C

Scenario.

**8.8.1.6 Africa: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $790 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments in

plant replacement after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $22 billion per

year. The largest share of investment in Africa is assumed to be for heat pumps

(around $370 billion), followed by solar collectors and biomass technologies. The

1.5  °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technologies.

However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0 °C Scenario) will result in

a lower average annual investment of around $21 billion per year (Table 8.43,

Fig. 8.49).

**8.8.1.7 Africa: Transport**

The energy demand in the transport sector in Africa is expected to increase by 131%
in the 5.0 °C Scenario, from around 4400 PJ/year in 2015 to 10,100 PJ/year in 2050.
In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes will
save 53% (5410 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario. Additional
modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the transport demand will lead
to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 63% (or 6360 PJ/year) in
2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.44, Fig. 8.50).
By 2030, electricity will provide 4% (50 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s total
energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas by 2050, the share will be 28% (370
TWh/year). In 2050, up to 410 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the transport
sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand will be 360 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a
hydrogen demand of 340 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 2300 PJ/year.
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be introduced,
with a maximum amount of 700 PJ/year in 2050. With the lower overall energy
demand by transport, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a maxi-
mum of 1700 PJ/year The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to 470 PJ/
year.

**8.8.1.8 Africa: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, Africa’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by 126%, from
1140 Mt. in 2015 to 2585 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures in both

2.0 °C Scenario and to 200 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further reductions to

almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions from 2015
until 2050 will add up to 66 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, the

cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 27 Gt and 22 Gt,
respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 59% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 67% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by the
‘Industry’ and ‘Residential and other’ sectors (Fig. 8.51).

**8.8.1.9 Africa: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-
tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.52. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the primary energy demand will increase by 50% from around 33,200 PJ/
year in 2015 to around 50,000 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario,
the overall primary energy demand will decrease by 26% by 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario (5.0  °C: 67700 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the primary energy
demand will be even lower (48,000 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand
and conversion losses will be lower.
Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This
will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 56% in 2030 and
98% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a
primary energy share of more than 98% in 2050 (including non-energy consump-
tion, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out by

2035 under both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario. The cumulative primary

energy consumption of natural gas in the 5.0  °C case will add up to 290 EJ, the

cumulative coal consumption to about 210 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 390

EJ. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to

130 EJ, the cumulative coal demand to 70 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 180

EJ. Even lower fossil fuel use will achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 110 EJ for natu-

ral gas, 50 EJ for coal, and 150 EJ for oil.

**8.8.2 Africa: Power Sector Analysis**

The African continent has 54 countries and its geographic, economic, and climatic

diversity are significant. Its regional breakdown into sub-regions tries to reflect this

diversity, but still requires a level of simplification. There is no pan-African power

grid yet, although it is currently under discussion. The African Clean Energy

Corridor (ACEC) is the most prominent regional initiative and aims to connect the

Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) with the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP). It

was politically endorsed in January 2014 at the Assembly of the International

Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA [^2014]:).

**8.8.2.1 Africa: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

In 2050, Africa’s most important renewable power-generation technology in both

scenarios will be solar PV. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, solar PV will provide just over

40% of the total generation capacity, followed by onshore wind (with 24%), hydro-

gen power (15%), and CSP plants (located in the desert regions), with 10% of the

total capacity. All other renewable power plant technologies will have only 2%–3%

shares. The 2.0 °C Scenario will arrive at similar capacities by 2050, although the

transition times in the two scenarios differ. Africa must build up solar PV and

onshore wind markets equal to the market sizes in China in 2017: 50 GW of solar

PV installation (REN21-GSR2018) and 23 GW of onshore wind (GWEC [^2018]:).

The market for CSP plants must reach about 1 GW per year by 2025, increasing

rapidly to 3 GW per year in 2029 and 15 GW per year in 2035 (Table 8.45).

**8.8.2.2 Africa: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

Africa’s sub-regions are assumed to have an interconnection capacity of 5% at the

beginning of the calculation period (2015). This capacity is not required for any

exchange of variable electricity production, because currently, shares are only at or

below 2% of the total generation capacity (Table 8.46). However, the variable gen-

eration capacity will increase rapidly towards 2030. We assume that the intercon-

nection capacity between sub-regions will increase and that initiatives such as the

African Clean Energy Corridor (ACEC) will be implemented successfully.

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```
281
```

The development of average capacity factors for each generation type will follow

the same trend as in most world regions. Table 8.47 shows the significant drop in the

capacity factors of limited dispatchable power plants under the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.8.2.3 Africa: Development of Load, Generation, and Residual Load**

Table 8.48 shows that under the 2.0 °C Scenario, the transmission capacities need

not exceed the assumed 25% interconnection capacity. If the exchange capacity

between Africa’s sub-regions is 20%—as calculated under the 1.5  °C Scenario—

additional capacity will be required. Therefore, a 25% interconnection capacity

seems a good target for high renewable penetration scenarios in Africa. The load in

all sub-regions—from North Africa to South Africa—will increase significantly.

The greatest increase is calculated for Southern Africa, with the load increasing by

a factor of 7, followed by Central Africa (a factor of 6.5), East Africa (6), West

Africa (5.5), and North Africa (4). The load increase in the Republic of South Africa

will follow the patterns of other industrialized countries, more than doubling, due

mainly to increases in electric mobility. The load increases in other parts of Africa

will be first and foremost due to universal access to energy services for all house-

holds and favourable economic development.

```
Table 8.49 provides an overview of the calculated storage and dispatch power
```

requirements by African sub-region. East and West Africa will require the highest

battery capacity, due to the very high share of solar PV battery systems in rural and

residential areas with low power grid availability. Like the Middle East, Africa is

one of the global renewable fuel production regions and it is assumed that all sub-
regions of Africa have equal amounts of energy export potential. However, a more
detailed examination of export energy is required, which is beyond the scope of this
project.

**8.9 The Middle East**

**8.9.1 The Middle East: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.9.1.1 The Middle East: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for the Middle East’s final energy demand when
the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are com-
bined are shown in Fig. 8.53 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the
5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 133% from the cur-
rent 17,100 PJ/year to around 40,000 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the
final energy demand will decrease by 8% compared with current consumption and
will reach 15,800 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario
will reach 13,600 PJ, 20% below the 2015 demand level. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the
final energy demand in 2050 will be 14% lower than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. The

electricity demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or

e-mobility) will increase from 650 TWh/year in 2015 to 1230 TWh/year (2.0 °C)

and 1160 TWh/year (1.5 °C) by 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (2330 TWh/

year in 2050), the efficiency measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will save

a maximum of 1100 TWh/year and 1170 TWh/year, respectively.

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will rise to approximately 800

TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector, the

demand will rise to approximately 1700 TWh/year due to the increase in electric

mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process

heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an addi-

tional power demand of 1900 TWh/year. The gross power demand will thus rise

from 1100 TWh/year in 2015 to 4700 TWh/year in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario,

57% higher than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the gross electricity

demand will increase to a maximum of 4100 TWh/year by 2045.

```
The efficiency gains could be even larger in the heating sector than in the elec-
```

tricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 10,100 PJ/year and 10,500 PJ/year, respectively, will be avoided

through efficiency gains by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.9.1.2 The Middle East: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in the Middle East will

come from renewable energy sources under the 2.0  °C Scenario. ‘New’ renew-

ables—mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 96% of the total

electricity generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be

49% by 2030 and 91% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach

about 430 GW by 2030 and 1910 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity

generation in 2030  in the 1.5  °C Scenario is assumed to be 58%. In the 1.5  °C

Scenario, the generation capacity from renewable energy will be approximately

1700 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.50 shows the development of different renewable technologies in the
```

Middle East over time. Figure 8.54 provides an overview of the overall power-

generation structure in the Middle East. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth

of wind and PV, up to 480 GW and 1070 GW, respectively, will be complemented

by up to 250 GW of solar thermal generation, as well as limited biomass, geother-

mal, and ocean energy, in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C

Scenario will lead to high proportions of variable power generation (PV, wind, and

ocean) of 39% and 46%, respectively, by 2030, and 64% and 66%, respectively, by

2050.

**8.9.1.3 The Middle East: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.55 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated
electricity-generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 7.1 ct/kWh.

In the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2030, when they reach
14.8 ct/kWh, and then drop to 13.7 ct/kWh by 2050. The generation costs in the
2.0  °C Scenario will increase until 2030, when they reach 11.1 ct/kWh, and then
drop to 6.1 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 10.7 ct/
kWh, and then drop to 7.3 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation
costs in 2050 will be 7.6 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario,
the generation costs in 2050 will be 6.4 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. Note
that these estimates of generation costs do not take into account integration costs
such as power grid expansion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will cause
the total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $70 billion/year to more than
$410 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs will be $300
billion/year and in the 1.5  °C Scenario, they will be $310 billion/year. The long-
term cost of electricity supply will be more than 27% lower in the 2.0 °C Scenario
than in the 5.0  °C Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and the
electrification of heating and mobility. Further demand reductions in the 1.5  °C
Scenario will result in total power-generation costs that are 24% lower than in the
5.0 °C case.

generation costs in the scenarios

```

The generation costs without the CO[^2]: emission costs will increase in the 5.0 °C
case to 11.1 ct/kWh by 2030, and then stabilize at 10.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the

2.0 °C Scenario and the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to a maximum of 9 ct/

kWh in 2030, before they drop to 6.1 ct/kWh and 7.3 ct/kWh by 2050, respectively.

In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the generation costs will be 4.7 ct/kWh lower than in the

5.0 °C case and this maximum difference will occur in 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario,

the maximum difference in generation costs compared with the 5.0 °C case will be

3.5 ct/kWh in 2050. If the CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total electricity supply
costs in the 5.0 °C case will rise to about $320 billion/year by 2050.

**8.9.1.4 The Middle East: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $3450 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replace-
ment at the ends of their economic lives. This value will be equivalent to approxi-
mately $96 billion per year on average, and this is $2720 billion more than in the
5.0 °C case ($730 billion). An investment of around $3470 billion for power genera-
tion will be required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario, or on average,
$96 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment in conventional power
plants will be around 68% of the total cumulative investments, whereas approxi-
mately 32% will be invested in renewable power generation and co-generation
(Fig. 8.56). However, in both alternative scenarios, the Middle East will shift almost
94% of its entire investments to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil
fuel share of power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas power plants
that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $2900 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $81 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 110% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $3100 billion,
or $86 billion per year.

**8.9.1.5 The Middle East: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase by 139% in the 5.0 °C Scenario,
from 7100 PJ/year in 2015 to 17,100 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 59% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario, relative to the 5.0  °C case, and by 62% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Today,
renewables supply almost none of the Middle East’s final energy demand for heat-
ing. Renewable energy will provide 23% of the Middle East’s total heat demand in
2030  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and 25% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. In both scenarios,
renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.

supplement electrification, with solar heat becoming the main direct renewable heat
source in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario.
Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels
in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 950 PJ/year in the
2.0 °C Scenario and 920 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of electricity
for heating will also increase by a factor of 9–10 between 2015 and 2050, and its
final energy share will be 36% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 43% in the 1.5 °C
Scenario (Fig. 8.57).

**8.9.1.6 The Middle East: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies to 2050 will
amount to less than $440 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments for
plant replacement after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $12 billion per
year. The largest share of investments in the Middle East is assumed to be for heat
pumps (more than $200 billion), followed by solar collectors and geothermal heat
use. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technolo-
gies. However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0  °C Scenario) will
result in a lower average annual investment of around $10 billion per year
(Table 8.52, Fig. 8.58).

**8.9.1.7 The Middle East: transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in the Middle East is expected to increase in
the 5.0 °C Scenario by 133%, from around 5700 PJ/year in 2015 to 13,300 PJ/year
in 2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural
changes will save 67% (8860 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.
Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the transport
demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 79% (or
10,400 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.53, Fig. 8.59).
By 2030, electricity will provide 4% (70 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s total
energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 39% (480
TWh/year). In 2050, up to 620 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the transport
sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand will be 350 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a
hydrogen demand of 450 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 370 PJ/year.
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-
duced, with a maximum consumption of 1670 PJ/year in 2050. Biofuel use in the
1.5 °C Scenario with have a maximum of 430 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel
demand will amount to 920 PJ/year.

**8.9.1.8 The Middle East: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0  °C Scenario, the Middle East’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by
76% from 1760 Mt. in 2015 to 3094 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures

in both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 510 Mt. in

2040  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and to 220 Mt. in the 1.5  °C Scenario, with further

reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 90 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 38
Gt and 31 Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 58% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 66% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Industry’ followed by the ‘Power gen-
eration’ and ‘Transport’ sectors (Fig. 8.60).

**8.9.1.9 The Middle East: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-
tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.61. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 16%, from around 30,300
PJ/year in 2015 to 25,400 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, the
overall primary energy demand will decrease by 59% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario
(5.0 °C: 61,700 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will
be even lower (22,300 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conversion
losses will be lower.

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

298

Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This

will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 18% in 2030 and

88% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a

primary energy share of more than 86% in 2050 (including non-energy consump-

tion, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out in

2035 in both the 2.0 °C and the 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy

consumption of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 830 EJ, the cumulative

coal consumption to about 10 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 630 EJ. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 330 EJ, the cumulative

coal demand to 1 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 310 EJ. Even lower fossil

fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 280 EJ for natural gas, 0.9 EJ for

coal, and 270 EJ for oil.

**8.9.2 The Middle East: Power Sector Analysis**

The Middle East has significant renewable energy potential. The region’s solar radi-

ation is among the highest in the world and it has good wind conditions in coastal

areas and in its mountain ranges. The electricity market is fragmented, and policies

differ significantly. However, most countries are connected to their neighbours by

transmission lines. Saudi Arabia, the geographic centre of the region, has connec-

tions to most neighbouring countries. Both the 2.0  °C Scenario and the 1.5  °C

Scenario assume that the Middle East will remain a significant player in the energy

market, moving from oil and gas to solar, and that it will play an important role in

producing synthetic fuels and hydrogen for export.

**8.9.2.1 The Middle East: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The overwhelming majority of fossil-fuel-based power generation in the Middle

East is from gas-fired power plants. Both scenarios assume that this gas capacity (in

GW) will remain on the same level until 2050, but will be converted to hydrogen.

The annual market for solar PV must increase to 2.5 GW in 2020 and to 28.5 GW

by 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and to 35 GW in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The onshore

wind market must expand to 10 GW by 2025 in both scenarios. This represents a

very ambitious target because the market for wind power plants in the Middle East

has never been higher than 117 MW (GWEC [^2018]:) (in 2015). Parts of the offshore

oil and gas industry can be transitioned into an offshore wind industry. The total

capacity assumed for the Middle East by 2050 is 20–25 GW under both scenarios.

For comparison, the UK had an installed capacity for offshore wind of 6.8 GW and

Germany of 5.4 GW in 2017 (GWEC [^2018]:). The vast solar resources in the Middle

East make it suitable for CSP plants—the total capacity by 2050 is calculated to be

252 GW (2.0 °C Scenario), equal to the gas power plant capacity in the Middle East

in 2017 (Table 8.54).

**8.9.2.2 Middle East: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

In 2015, the base year of the scenario calculations, the Middle East had less than

0.5% variable power generation. Table 8.55 shows the rapidly increasing shares of

variable renewable power generation across the Middle East. Israel is included in

the Middle East region (as opposed to the IEA region used for the long-term sce-

nario) to reflect its current and possible future interconnection with the regional

power system. The current interconnection capacity between all sub-regions is

assumed to be 5%, increasing to 20% in 2030 and 25% in 2050. Dispatchable

renewables will have a stable market share of around 15%–20% over the entire

modelling period in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 15%–20% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Average capacity factors correspond to the results for the other world regions.

Table 8.56 shows that the limited dispatchable fossil and nuclear generation will

drop quickly, whereas the significant gas power plant capacity within the region can

increase capacity factors to take over their load and reduce carbon emissions at an

early stage. The calculation results are attributed to the assumed dispatch order,

which prioritizes gas over coal and nuclear.

**8.9.2.3 The Middle East: Development of Load, Generation,**

**and Residual Load**

The Middle East is assumed to be one of the exporters of solar electricity into the

EU, so the calculated solar installation capacities throughout the region will be sig-

nificantly higher than required for self-supply.

```
Table 8.57 shows a negative residual load in almost all sub-regions for every year
```

and in both scenarios. This is attributable to substantial oversupply, so the produc-

tion of renewables is almost constantly higher than the demand. This electricity has

been calculated as exports from the Middle East and imports to Europe.

The Middle East will be one of three dedicated renewable energy export regions.

These exports are in the form of renewable fuels and electricity. The [R]E 24/7

model does not calculate electricity exchange in 1 h steps between the world regions,

and therefore the amount of electricity exported accumulates from year to year. The

load curves for the Middle East and European regions are not calculated

separately.

```
Table 8.58 provides an overview of the calculated storage and dispatch power
```

requirements by sub-region in the Middle East. Iran and Saudi Arabia West Africa

will require the highest storage capacity, due to the very high share of solar PV

systems in residential areas. Like the Africa, the Middle East is one of the global

renewable fuel production regions and it is assumed that all sub-regions of the

Middle East have equal amounts of energy export potential. However, a more

detailed examination of export energy is required, which is beyond the scope of this

project.

**8.10 Eastern Europe/Eurasia**

**8.10.1 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.10.1.1 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for Eastern Europe/Eurasia’s final energy demand
when the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are
combined are shown in Fig. 8.62 for the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Scenarios. In the
5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 45%, from the cur-
rent 25,500 PJ/year to 37,000 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the final
energy demand will decrease by 25% compared with current consumption and will
reach 19,100 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will
reach 17,800 PJ, 30% below the 2015 level. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final energy
demand in 2050 will be 7% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario. The electricity
demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will
increase from 910 TWh/year in 2015 to 1000 TWh/year (2.0 °C) or 940 TWh/year
(1.5  °C) by 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C case (1600 TWh/year in 2050), the
efficiency measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will save a maximum of 600
TWh/year and 660 TWh/year, respectively.

scenarios

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be approxi-

mately 700 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport

sector, the electricity demand will be approximately 2300 TWh/year due to increased

electric mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature

process heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add

an additional power demand of 2300 TWh/year. Therefore, the gross power demand

will rise from 1700 TWh/year in 2015 to 4900 TWh/year in 2050  in the 2.0  °C

Scenario, 88% higher than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the gross elec-

tricity demand will increase to a maximum of 4800 TWh/year in 2050.

Efficiency gains could be even larger in the heating sector than in the electricity

sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equivalent to

more than 10,700 PJ/year is avoided by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario

through efficiency gains.

**8.10.1.2 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in Eastern Europe/Eurasia

will come from renewable energy sources in the 2.0  °C Scenario. ‘New’ renew-

ables—mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 75% of the total

electricity generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be

55% by 2030 and 84% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach

about 560 GW by 2030 and 1900 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity

generation in 2030  in the 1.5  °C Scenario is assumed to be 66%. In the 1.5  °C

Scenario, the generation capacity from renewable energy will be approximately

1870 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.59 shows the development of different renewable technologies in Eastern
```

Europe/Eurasia over time. Figure 8.63 provides an overview of the overall power-

generation structure in Eastern Europe/Eurasia. From 2020 onwards, the continuing

growth of wind and PV, up to 740 GW and 820 GW, respectively, will be comple-

mented by up to 30 GW of solar thermal generation, as well as limited biomass,

geothermal, and ocean energy, in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and

1.5  °C Scenario will lead to a high proportion of variable power generation (PV,

wind, and ocean) of 28% and 32%, respectively, by 2030, and 62% and 61%,

respectively, by 2050.

**8.10.1.3 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.64 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated
electricity-generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 4.5 ct/kWh.

In the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when they reach 10
ct/kWh. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when
they will reach 8.6 ct/kWh. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 9.3 ct/kWh,
and then drop to 8.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs in
2050 will be 1.4 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the
generation costs in 2050 will be 1.1 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. Note that
these estimates of generation costs do not take into account integration costs such as
power grid expansion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.

## Fig. 8.64 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: development of total electricity supply costs and specific

electricity-generation costs in the scenarios

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

310

In the 5.0 °C case, the growth of demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $120 billion/year to more
than $320 billion/year in 2050. In both alternative scenarios, the total supply costs
will be $490 billion/year in 2050. The long-term costs of electricity supply will be
more than 54% higher in the 2.0 °C Scenario than in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result
of the estimated generation costs and the electrification of heating and mobility.
Further electrification and synthetic fuel generation in the 1.5  °C Scenario will
result in total power generation costs that are 55% higher than in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0  °C case to 6.9 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C

Scenario, the generation costs will increase continuously until 2050, when they

reach 8.6 ct/kWh. They will increase to 8.8 ct/kWh in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In the

2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs will reach a maximum, at 1.7 ct/kWh higher

than in the 5.0 °C case, and this will occur in 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the maxi-

mum difference in generation costs compared with the 5.0 °C case will be 2.6 ct/

kWh in 2040. The generation costs in 2050 will still be 2 ct/kWh higher than in the

5.0 °C case. If the CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total electricity supply costs in
the 5.0 °C case will rise to about $240 billion in 2050.

**8.10.1.4 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Future Investments in the Power**
**Sector**

An investment of around $3600 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replace-
ment at the end of their economic lives. This value is equivalent to approximately
$100 billion per year on average, and is $2660 billion more than in the 5.0 °C case
($940 billion). An investment of around $3770 billion for power generation will be
required between 2015 and 2050  in the 1.5  °C Scenario. On average, this is an
investment of $105 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment in con-
ventional power plants will be around 40% of the total cumulative investments,
whereas approximately 60% will be invested in renewable power generation and
co-generation (Fig. 8.65).
However, in the 2.0  °C (1.5  °C) scenario, Eastern Europe/Eurasia will shift
almost 97% (98%) of its entire investments to renewables and co-generation. By
2030, the fossil fuel share of the power sector investments will predominantly focus
on gas power plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $1730 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $48 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 70% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $1900 billion,
or $53 billion per year.

**8.10.1.5 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 46%,
from 15,700 PJ/year in 2015 to 22,900 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 47% in 2050 in both alterna-
tive scenarios. Today, renewables supply around 4% of Eastern Europe/Eurasia’s
final energy demand for heating, with the main contribution from biomass.
Renewable energy will provide 29% of Eastern Europe/Eurasia’s total heat demand
in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 42% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios,
renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.
Figure 8.66 shows the development of different technologies for heating in
Eastern Europe/Eurasia over time, and Table 8.60 provides the resulting renewable
heat supply for all scenarios. Until 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor.
In the long term, the growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will
lead to a biomass share of 28% in both alternative scenarios.
Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels
in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 1900 PJ/year in
the 2.0 °C Scenario and 2000 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

The direct use of electricity for heating will also increases by a factor of 2.7

between 2015 and 2050, and its final energy share will be 18% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C

Scenario and 19% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.10.1.6 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Future Investments in the Heating**

**Sector**

The roughly estimated investment in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $1070 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments

in plant replacement after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $30 billion

per year. The largest share of the investments in Eastern Europe/Eurasia is assumed

to be for heat pumps (around $490 billion), followed by solar collectors and bio-

mass technologies. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renew-

able technologies. However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0  °C

Scenario) will result in a lower average annual investment of around $29 billion per

year (Table 8.61, Fig. 8.67).

**8.10.1.7 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in Eastern Europe/Eurasia is expected to

increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 34%, from around 6000 PJ/year in 2015 to 8000

PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behav-

ioural changes will save 48% (3840 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0  °C

Scenario. Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the

transport demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of

62% (or 4970 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.62, Fig. 8.68).

By 2030, electricity will provide 14% (240 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 54%
(630 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 410 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-
port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand will be 510 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a
hydrogen demand of 330 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 720 PJ/year
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

314

duced, with a maximum amount of 880 PJ/year in 2050. With the lower overall
energy demand in transport, biofuel use will also be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario
to a maximum of 700 PJ/year The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to
540 PJ/year.

**8.10.1.8 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, Eastern Europe/Eurasia’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase
by 14%, from 2420 Mt. in 2015 to 2768 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation mea-
sures in both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 590 Mt.
in 2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 340 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further
reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 95 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C
Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 45
Gt and 36 Gt, respectively.

## Fig. 8.68 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: final energy consumption by transport in the scenarios

Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 53% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 62% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by the
‘Residential and other’ and ‘Industry’ sectors (Fig. 8.69).

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

316

**8.10.1.9 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-
tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.70. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 25%, from around 46,000
PJ/year in 2015 to 34,600 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, the
overall primary energy demand will decrease by 40% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario
(5.0 °C: 57,700 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will
be even lower (33,600 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conversion
losses will be lower.
Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This
will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 26% in 2030 and
91% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a
primary energy share of more than 90% in 2050 (including non-energy consump-
tion, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out by
2040  in both the 2.0  °C Scenario and 1.5  °C Scenario. The cumulative primary
energy consumption of natural gas in the 5.0  °C case will add up to 840 EJ, the
cumulative coal consumption to about 290 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 340
EJ. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to
510 EJ, the cumulative coal demand to 100 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to
160 EJ. Even lower fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 450 EJ
for natural gas, 70 EJ for coal, and 120 EJ for oil.

**8.10.2 Eastern Europe/Eurasia: Power Sector Analysis**

This region sits between the strong economic hubs of the EU, China, and India.

Russia, by far the largest country within this region, is an important producer of oil

and gas, and supplies all surrounding countries. Therefore, Eurasia will be key in

future energy developments. Its renewable energy industry is among the smallest in

the world, but recent developments indicate growth in both the wind (WPM 3-[^2018]:)

and solar industries (PVM 3-[^2018]:).

**8.10.2.1 Eurasia: Development of Power Plant Capacities—2.0 °C**

**Scenario**

The northern part of Eurasia and Mongolia have significant wind potential, whereas

the southern part, especially in Central Asia, has substantial possibilities for utility-

scale solar power plants—both for solar PV and concentrated solar. The annual

market for solar PV and onshore wind—as for all other renewable power generation

technologies—must develop from a very low MW range in 2017 to a GW market by

2025. Besides solar PV and onshore wind, bioenergy has significant potential in

Eurasia, especially in the European part, Russia, and the agricultural regions around

the Caspian Sea (Table 8.63).

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

318

**8.10.2.2 Eurasia: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

Variable power generation starts at almost zero, but increases rapidly to over 30% in

most sub-regions of Eurasia, as shown in Table 8.64.

```
Table 8.64 shows that dispatchable renewables will experience stable market
```

conditions throughout the entire modelling period across the whole region. Both

scenarios assume that the interconnections between Eastern Europe and Russia will

increase significantly, whereas the power transmission capacities for Kazakhstan,

Central Asia, the area around the Caspian Sea, and Mongolia will remain low due to

geographic distances.

Compared with other world regions, it will take longer for the capacity factor of

the limited dispatchable power plants to drop below economic viability, as shown in

Table 8.65.

```
Table 8.65. The capacity factor of variable renewables will rise by 2030, mainly
```

due to increased deployment of wind and concentrated solar power with storage.

The average capacity factor of the power-generation fleet will be around 35% by

2050 and will therefore be on the same level as it was 2015 in both scenarios.

**8.10.2.3 Eurasia: Development of Load, Generation, and Residual Load**

The modelling of both scenarios predicts small increases in interconnection beyond

those assumed to occur by 2030 (see Table 8.64).

Table 8.64. However, after 2030, significant increases will be required by 2050,
especially in Russia. The export of renewable electricity can also take place via
existing gas pipelines with power-to-gas technologies. Between 2030 and 2050, the
loads for all regions will double, due to the increased electrification of the heating,
industry, and transport sectors (Table 8.66).
In Eurasia, the main storage technology for both scenarios is pumped hydro,
whereas hydrogen plays a major role for the grid integration of variable generation
(Table 8.67). Hydrogen production can also be used for load management, although
not for short peak loads. Due to the technical and economic limitations associated
with the increased interconnection via transmission lines and pumped hydro storage
systems, curtailment will be higher than the scenario target (a maximum of 10% by
2050). For Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the East Caspian Sea, the
calculated curtailment will be between 10% and 14%, whereas the West Caspian
Region will have the highest curtailment of 19% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 17% in
the 1.5 °C Scenario. Further research and optimization are required.

## Fig. 8.71 Non-OECD Asia: development of the final energy demand by sector in the scenarios

**8.11 Non-OECD Asia**

**8.11.1 Non-OECD Asia: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.11.1.1 Non-OECD Asia: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for Non-OECD Asia’s final energy demand when
the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are com-
bined are shown in Fig. 8.71 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the
5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 111% from the cur-
rent 24,500 PJ/year to 51,800 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the final
energy demand will increase at a much lower rate by 16% compared with current
consumption, and will reach 28,300 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in
the 1.5 °C Scenario will reach 25,700 PJ, 5% above the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C
Scenario, the final energy demand in 2050 will be 9% lower than in the 2.0  °C
Scenario. The electricity demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-
to-heat or e-mobility) will increase from 830 TWh/year in 2015 to 2480 TWh/year
in 2050 in both alternative scenarios. Compared with the reference case (3880 TWh/
year in 2050), the efficiency measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios will save
1400 TWh/year in 2050.
Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be approxi-

mately 1500 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport

sector, the electricity demand will be approximately 1700 TWh/year due to electric

mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process

heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an addi-

tional power demand of 1700 TWh/year. Therefore, the gross power demand will

rise from 1400 TWh/year in 2015 to 6400 TWh/year in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario,

33% higher than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the gross electricity

demand will increase to a maximum of 6000 TWh/year in 2050.

The efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than those in the

electricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption

equivalent to about 6900 PJ/year and 8100 PJ/year, respectively, will be avoided by

2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, through efficiency gains.

**8.11.1.2 Non-OECD Asia: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in Non-OECD Asia will

come from renewable energy sources in the 2.0  °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—

mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 87% of the total electric-

ity generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 59% by

2030 and 87% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 610

GW by 2030 and 2430 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity generation

in 2030  in the 1.5  °C Scenario is assumed to be 74%. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the

generation capacity from renewable energy will be approximately 2320 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.68 shows the development of different renewable technologies in Non-
```

OECD Asia over time. Figure 8.72 provides an overview of the overall power-

generation structure in Non-OECD Asia. From 2020 onwards, the continuing

growth of wind and PV up to 635 GW and 1280 GW, respectively, will be comple-

mented by up to 275 GW solar thermal generation, as well as limited biomass,

geothermal, and ocean energy in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and

1.5  °C Scenario will lead to a high proportion of variable power generation (PV,

wind, and ocean) of 34% and 48%, respectively, by 2030, and 64% and 66%,

respectively, by 2050.

**8.11.1.3 Non-OECD Asia: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.73 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated elec-
tricity generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 5.2 ct/kWh. In

the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2050, when they reach 11.7
ct/kWh. The generation costs will increase in the 2.0 °C Scenario until 2030, when
they will reach 8.1 ct/kWh, and will drop to 6.3 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5  °C

## Fig. 8.73 Non-OECD Asia: development of total electricity supply costs and specific electricity

generation costs in the scenarios

Scenario, they will increase to 7.9 ct/kWh, and drop to 6.1 ct/kWh by 2050. In both
alternative scenarios, the generation costs in 2050 will be around 5.5 ct/kWh lower
than in the 5.0 °C case. Note that these estimates of generation costs do not take into
account integration costs such as power grid expansion, storage, or other load-
balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $70 billion/year to more
than $560 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs will be
$430 billion/year and in the 1.5  °C Scenario they will be $390 billion/year. The
long-term costs for electricity supply will be more than 24% lower in the 2.0  °C
Scenario than in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and
the electrification of heating and mobility. Further reductions in demand in the
1.5 °C Scenario will result in total power generation costs that are 30% lower than
in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0  °C case to 7.4 ct/kWh. In the 2.0  °C

Scenario, they still increase until 2030, when they reach 6.5 ct/kWh, and then drop

to 6.3 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 6.9 ct/kWh and

then drop to 6.1 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C case, the generation costs will be

maximum in 2050, and 1.1 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C, whereas they will be

1.3 ct/kWh in the 1.5  °C Scenario. If the CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total
electricity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will increase to about $360 billion/year in

2050.

**8.11.1.4 Non-OECD Asia: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of $4030 billion will be required for power generation between 2015
and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including investment in additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in plant replace-
ment at the end of their economic lifetimes. This value is equivalent to approxi-
mately $112 billion per year on average, and is $2660 billion more than in the
5.0 °C case ($1370 billion). An investment of around $3950 billion for power gen-
eration will be required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average,
this is an investment of $110 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment
in conventional power plants will be around 55% of the total cumulative invest-
ments, whereas approximately 45% will be invested in renewable power generation
and co-generation (Fig. 8.74).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, Non-OECD Asia will shift almost 93%
(95%) of its entire investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil
fuel share of power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas power plants
that can also be operated with hydrogen.

Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative fuel
cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $2610 billion in 2050, equiva-
lent to $73 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be equivalent to
98% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0 °C Scenario. The fuel cost
savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $2770 billion, or $77 billion per year.

**8.11.1.5 Non-OECD Asia: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase by 103% in the 5.0 °C scenario,
from 10,800 PJ/year in 2015 to 21,900 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 32% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C
Scenario, relative to the 5.0  °C case, and by 37% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Today,
renewables supply around 43% of Non-OECD Asia’s final energy demand for heat-
ing, with the main contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 57%
of Non-OECD Asia’s total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 70% in
the 1.5 °C Scenario. In both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total
heat demand in 2050.
Figure 8.75 shows the development of different technologies for heating in Non-
OECD Asia over time, and Table 8.69 provides the resulting renewable heat supply
for all scenarios. Up to 2030, biomass remains the main contributor. In the long
term, the growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead to a
biomass share of 40% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 38% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The
heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in
both scenarios. The hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 900 PJ/year in
the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1300 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of elec-
tricity for heating will also increase by a factor of 5-5.7 between 2015 and 2050.
Energy for heating will have a final energy share of 34% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and 32% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.11.1.6 Non-OECD Asia: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $1120 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments

for the replacement of plants after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $31

billion per year. The largest share of investment in Non-OECD Asia is assumed to

be for solar collectors (around $480 billion), followed by heat pumps and geother-

mal heat use. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable

technologies. However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0 °C Scenario)

will results in a lower average annual investment of around $28 billion per year

(Table 8.70, Fig. 8.76).

**8.11.1.7 Non-OECD Asia: Transport**

The energy demand in the transport sector in Non-OECD Asia is expected to

increase in 2015  in the 5.0  °C Scenario from around 6500 PJ/year by 102% to

13,200 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and

behavioural changes will save 63% (8320 PJ/year) by 2050 compared to the 5.0 °C

Scenario. Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the

transport demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of

73% (or 9660 PJ/year) by 2050 compared to the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.71, Fig. 8.77).

By 2030, electricity will provide 6% (120 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 36%
(480 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 650 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-

port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual

electricity demand will be 350 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a

hydrogen demand of 500 PJ/year by 2050.

Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 1940 PJ/year

Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-

duced, with a maximum amount of 530 PJ/year in 2050. Due to the lower overall

energy demand in transport, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a

maximum of 1540 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to
280 PJ/year.

**8.11.1.8 Non-OECD Asia: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, Non-OECD Asia’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by
160%, from 1880 Mt. in 2015 to 4880 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation mea-

sures in both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 630 Mt.
in 2040 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 330 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further
reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 121 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C
Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 42
Gt and 32 Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 65% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 74% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by the
‘Residential and other’ and ‘Industry’ sectors (Fig. 8.78).

**8.11.1.9 Non-OECD Asia: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-

tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.79. In the 2.0 °C

Scenario, the primary energy demand will increase by 13%, from around 38,100 PJ/

year in 2015 to 43,200 PJ/year. Compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario, the overall

primary energy demand will decrease by 47% by 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario

(5.0 °C: 81600 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will

be even lower (39,300 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conversion

losses will be lower.

Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario aim to rapidly phase-out coal and

oil. This will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 40% in 2030

and 93% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, renewables will

have a primary energy share of more than 92% in 2050 (including non-energy con-

sumption, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased out by

2045  in both the 2.0  °C Scenario and 1.5  °C Scenario. The cumulative primary

energy consumption of natural gas in the 5.0  °C case will add up to 430 EJ, the

cumulative coal consumption to about 530 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 580

EJ. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to

260 EJ, the cumulative coal demand to 120 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to

270 EJ. Even lower fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 230 EJ

for natural gas, 70 EJ for coal, and 190 EJ for oil.

**8.11.2 Non-OECD Asia: Power Sector Analysis**

Non-OECD Asia is the most heterogeneous region of all IEA world energy regions

because it includes not only all the ASEAN countries (ASEAN [^2018]:) of South East

Asia, but also central and south Asian nations, as well all 16 Pacific Island states. As

for the Caribbean Islands, a power system assessment—especially with regard to

possible storage demand—that examines all Pacific Island states together rather

than individually, is not sufficient to provide the actual required storage demand.

However, with this is in mind, the ratio of solar PV generation to storage require-

ments does provide some indication. A specific assessment for each of the Pacific

Island states is required, but is beyond the scope of this study. Indonesia and the

Philippines are selected as sub-regions because they are island states with some

interconnection between islands.

**8.11.2.1 Non-OECD Asia: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

Non-OECD Asia’s renewable power market can be subdivided into the following

categories: technologies for small and medium islands (mainly solar PV–battery

systems, mini-hydro and small-scale bioenergy systems); and utility-scale solar and

onshore wind for all major economies in mainland Asia or on the large islands of

the Philippines and Indonesia. Several countries in this region are on the Pacific

Ring of Fire and have significant geothermal energy resources. The annual market

for geothermal power plants is one of the world’s largest, with a projected 3–4 GW

each year for almost two decades between 2025 and 2045  in both scenarios

(Table 8.72).

**8.11.2.2 Non-OECD Asia: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

Due to the geographic diversity and wide distribution of all sub-regions of the Non-

OECD Asia region, it is assumed that there are no interconnection capacities avail-

able, and that there will not be any at the end of the modelling period (Table 8.73).

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```
337
```

In both scenarios, variable power generation will jump from only 1% today to

around 25% in all sub-regions, whereas dispatchable renewables will remain stable

at around 25%–30% until 2050.

Compared with other world regions, the capacity factors for limited dispatchable

fossil and nuclear energy will remain relatively high until 2030, as shown in

Table 8.74. The time required for variable power generation to replace fossil and

nuclear generation will be greater than it is in other regions. In the 1.5 °C Scenario,

all coal capacities across the region will be phased out by 2030, except for 4 GW

(equivalent to 4–5 power plants), which will be off-line 5 years later.

**8.11.2.3 Non-OECD Asia: Development of Load, Generation,**

**and Residual Load**

Because both scenarios were calculated under the assumption that there are no

interconnection capacities at the sub-regional level, more dispatch capacity will be

deployed. Table 8.75 shows that only Asia North-West and Asia South-West will

require some interconnection to avoid curtailment. The development of the maxi-

mum load, generation, and the resulting residual load—the load remaining after

variable renewable generation. According to the Philippine Department of Energy,

the peak demand in the Philippines in 2016 was 13.3 GW (PR-DoE [^2016]:) (9.7 GW

in Luzon, 1.9 GW in the Visayas, and 1.7 GW in Mindanao). The calculated load for

the Philippines in 2020 was 16.3 GW, which seems realistic. The load will increase

to 75.5 GW by 2050 under the 2.0  °C Scenario. The results for all Asian regions

show a quadrupling of load by 2050.

The lack of interconnection potential between or even within most sub-regions

will lead to some curtailment.

```
Table 8.76 shows that whereas countries on the Asian mainland will use and
```

increase their capacity for hydro pump storage electricity, batteries will be used for

most of the storage requirements of islands and island states. Where available, gas

infrastructure must be converted to hydrogen-operated systems.

**8.12 India**

**8.12.1 India: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.12.1.1 India: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for India’s final energy demand when the assump-
tions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are combined are
shown in Fig. 8.80 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the 5.0  °C
Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 201% from the current
22,200 PJ/year to 66,800 PJ/year by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy
demand will increase at a much slower rate by 57% compared with current con-
sumption and will reach 34,900 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the
1.5  °C Scenario will reach 31,900 PJ, 44% above the 2015 level. In the 1.5  °C
Scenario, the final energy demand in 2050 will be 9% lower than in the 2.0  °C
Scenario. The electricity demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-
to-heat or e-mobility) will increase from 750 TWh/year in 2015 to 3200 TWh/year
in 2050 in both alternative scenarios. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (4720 TWh/
year in 2050), efficiency measures in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios will save
around 1520 TWh/year by 2050.
Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be approximately
1900 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector,

the electricity demand will be approximately 3400 TWh/year due to electric mobil-

ity. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process heat)

and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an additional

power demand of 1700 TWh/year. Therefore, the gross power demand will increase

from 1400 TWh/year in 2015 to 8400 TWh/year in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario,

31% higher than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the gross electricity

demand will increases to a maximum of 7700 TWh/year in 2050.

Efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the electricity

sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equivalent to

about 9500 PJ/year and 9800 PJ/year, respectively, will be avoided through effi-

ciency gains by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.12.1.2 India: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in India will come from

renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—mainly wind,

solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 90% of the total electricity genera-

tion. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 66% by 2030 and

89% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 1060 GW by

2030 and 3360 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity generation in

2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario is assumed to be 77%. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the gen-

eration capacity from renewable energy will be approximately 3040 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.77 shows the development of different renewable technologies in India
```

over time. Figure 8.81 provides an overview of the overall power-generation struc-

ture in India. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and PV up to 1270

GW and 1570 GW, respectively, is complemented by up to 210 GW solar thermal

generation, as well as limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean energy, in the 2.0 °C

Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario will lead to a high propor-

tion of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 48% and 60%, respec-

tively, by 2030, and 75% and 72%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.12.1.3 India: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.82 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated elec-
tricity generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 5.4 ct/kWh. In

the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2040, when they reach 11 ct/
kWh, and then drop to 10.7 ct/kWh by 2050. The generation costs will increase in
the 2.0 °C Scenario until 2030, when they reach 8.4 ct/kWh, and then drop to 5.7 ct/
kWh by 2050. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, they will increase to 7.8 ct/kWh, and then
drop to 5.8 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation costs in 2050 will
be 5 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the generation

costs in 2050 will be 4.9 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case. Note that these esti-
mates of generation costs do not take into account integration costs such as power
grid expansion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $75 billion/year to more
than $690 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C case, the total supply costs will be $500
billion/year and in the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will be $470 billion/year. The long-term
costs for electricity supply will be more than 27% lower in the 2.0 °C Scenario than
in the 5.0 °C Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and the electrifi-
cation of heating and mobility. Further demand reductions in the 1.5  °C Scenario
will result in total power generation costs that are 32% lower than in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs, when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered, will increase in the 5.0 °C case to only 6.9 ct/kWh. In both alter-
native scenarios, they will still increase until 2030, when they reach 6.7 ct/kWh, and
then drop to around 5.8 ct/kWh by 2050. The maximum difference in generation
costs will be around 1 ct/kWh in 2050. If the CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total
electricity supply costs in the 5.0 °C case will rise to about $430 billion/year in 2050.

**8.12.1.4 India: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $5640 billion will be required for power generation between

2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants for the pro-

duction of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in the replacement of plants

after the end of their economic lifetimes. This value is equivalent to approximately $157

billion per year on average, and is $3310 billion more than in the 5.0 °C case ($2330
billion). An investment of around $5560 billion for power generation will be required
between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average, this will be an investment
of $154 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the investment in conventional power
plants will be around 48% of the total cumulative investments, whereas approximately
52% will be invested in renewable power generation and co-generation (Fig. 8.83).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, India will shift almost 94% (95%) of
its entire investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil fuel share
of the power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas power plants that
can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $3110 billion in 2050,
equivalent to $86 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be
equivalent to 90% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C
Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $3330 billion,
or $93 billion per year.

**8.12.1.5 India: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 133%,
from 11,900 PJ/year in 2015 to 27,800 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 34% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C

Scenario, relative to the 5.0  °C case, and by 35% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Today,

renewables supply around 47% of India’s final energy demand for heating, with the

main contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 53% of India’s

total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 68% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In

both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.

```

over time, and Table 8.78 provides the resulting renewable heat supply for all sce-

narios. Up to 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor. In the long term, the

increasing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead to a biomass

share of 38% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 36% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels

under both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 1400 PJ/year

in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1600 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of
electricity for heating will also increase by a factor of about 21 between 2015 and
2050, and the electricity for heating will have a final energy share of 36% in 2050 in
both alternative scenarios.

**8.12.1.6 India: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050
amount to around $930 billion in the 2.0  °C Scenario (including investments for
replacement after the economic lifetimes of the plants), or approximately $26 billion
per year. The largest share of investment in India is assumed to be for solar collectors
(around $490 billion), followed by heat pumps and biomass technologies. The 1.5 °C
Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technologies and results in a
higher average annual investment of around $29 billion per year (Table 8.79, Fig. 8.85).

**8.12.1.7 India: Transport**

The energy demand in the transport sector in India is expected to increase in the
5.0 °C Scenario by 377%, from around 3600 PJ/year in 2015 to 17,200 PJ/year in

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes
will save 66% (11,280 PJ/year) by 2050 compared to the 5.0 °C Scenario. Additional
modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the transport demand will lead
to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 81% (or 13,930 PJ/year) in
2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.80, Fig. 8.86).
By 2030, electricity will provide 10% (160 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 58%

(950 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 860 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-
port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand will be 560 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a
hydrogen demand of 590 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0 °C Scenario to a maximum of around 1000 PJ/year.
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be introduced,
with a maximum amount of 610 PJ/year in 2050. Due to the lower overall energy
demand in transport, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a maximum
of 510 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to 310 PJ/year.

**8.12.1.8 India: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, India’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by 236%, from
2060 Mt. in 2015 to 6950 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures in both

alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 930 Mt. in 2040 in the

2.0 °C Scenario and to 200 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further reductions to

almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions from 2015
until 2050 will add up to 169 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, the
cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 55 Gt and 38 Gt,
respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 67% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 78% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in the annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the

## Fig. 8.86 India: final energy consumption by transport in the scenarios

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

354

2.0 °C Scenario, the reduction will be greatest in the ‘Residential and other’ sector,

followed by the ‘Power generation’ and ‘Industry’ sectors (Fig. 8.87).

**8.12.1.9 India: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-

tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.88. In the 2.0 °C

Scenario, the primary energy demand will increase by 43%, from around 35,600 PJ/

year in 2015 to 50,900 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario, the

overall primary energy demand will decrease by 51% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario

(5.0 °C: 104,800 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand

will be even lower (47,100 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conver-

sion losses will be lower.

Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This

will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 40% in 2030 and

94% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a

primary energy share of more than 94% in 2050 (including non-energy consump-

tion, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased out by

2050 in both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy con-

sumption of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 160 EJ, the cumulative coal

consumption to about 1180 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 570 EJ. In contrast,

in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 120 EJ, the cumu-

lative coal demand to 360 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 220 EJ. Even lower

fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario: 130 EJ for natural gas, 220

EJ for coal, and 150 EJ for oil.

**8.12.2 India: Power Sector Analysis**

The electricity market in India is in dynamic development. The government of India

is making great efforts to increase the reliability of the power supply and at the same

time, it is developing universal access to electric power. In 2017, about 300 million

Indians (RF [^2018]:) had no power or inadequate power. In 2017, the Indian

Government launched _The Third National Electricity Plan_, which covers two 5-year

periods: 2017–2022 and 2022–2027. According to the International Energy Agency

(IEA) Policies and Measures Database (IEA P + M DB [^2018]:):

```
[...] “the plan covers short- and long-term demand forecasts in different regions and recom-
mend areas for transmission and generation capacity additions ... However, as India sets to
meet its first nationally-determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement ...
Highlights of the plan include, that during the period 2017–22, no additional capacity of
coal will be added – except for the coal power plants under construction [...]”.

narios (including electricity import balance)

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

In terms of renewable power generation, India aims to have a total capacity of 275

GW for solar and wind and 72 GW for hydro, with no further increase in the coal

power plant capacity until at least 2027.

**8.12.2.1 India: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The Third National Electricity Plan for India is an important foundation for strength-

ening India’s renewable power market in order to achieve the levels envisaged in

both alternative scenarios. Whereas the hydropower target is consistent with the

2.0 °C and 1.5 °C targets, the solar and wind capacity of 275 GW must be reached

between 2020 and 2025 for both scenarios. The annual installation rates for solar

PV installations must increase to around 50 GW—the market size in China in

2017—and remain at that level until 2040 to implement either the 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C

Scenario. The installation rates for onshore wind must be equally high. In 2017,

4.15 GW of new wind turbines were installed, and significant growth is required.

Offshore wind and concentrated solar power plants have significant potential for

selected regions of India. Both technologies are vital to achieving the 2.0  °C or

1.5 °C targets (Table 8.81).

**8.12.2.2 India: Utilization of Power-Generation Capacities**

The division of India into five sub-regions is intended to reflect the main grid zones

and it is assumed that interconnection will continue to increase to 15% in 2030 and

20% in 2050. Both scenarios aim for an even distribution of variable power plant

capacities across all Indian sub-regions. By 2030, the variable power generation

will reach 40% in most regions, whereas dispatchable renewables will supply about

one quarter of the demand by 2030 (Table 8.82).

India’s average capacity factors for the entire power plant fleet remain at around

35% over the entire modelling period, as the calculation results in Table 8.83 show.

Contributions from limited dispatchable fossil and nuclear power plants will remain

high until 2030 and indicate that a significant replacement of coal for electricity

must occur after 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, coal will be

phased-out just after 2035.

**8.12.2.3 India: Development of Load, Generation, and Residual Load**

Table 8.84 shows that India’s load is predicted to quadruple in all five sub-regions

between 2020 and 2050. Under the 2.0 °C Scenario, additional interconnection will

increase—beyond the assumed 20% target—but may only be required for the west-

ern and southern sub-regions of India. However, for the 1.5 °C Scenario, intercon-

nections must increase in four of the five regions. In the northern region, the

calculated generation increases faster than the demand. This region has significant

potential for concentrated solar power plants and could supply neighbouring

regions.

```
Table 8.85 shows the storage and dispatch requirements under the 2.0  °C and
```

1.5 °C Scenarios. All the regions remain within the maximum curtailment target of

10%. Table 8.71 provides an overview of the calculated storage and dispatch power

requirements by sub-region. Charging capacities are moderate compared with other

world regions. Compared to all other world regions, hydrogen dispatch utilization is

very low due to a relatively moderate increase in the gas and hydrogen capacities in

India.

**8.13 China**

**8.13.1 China: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.13.1.1 China: Final Energy Demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for China’s final energy demand when the assump-

tions on population growth, GDP growth and energy intensity are combined are

shown in Fig. 8.89 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the 5.0  °C

Scenario, the total final energy demand will increase by 56% from the current 73,600

PJ/year to 114,600 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy demand

will decreases by 26% compared with current consumption and will reach 54,400

PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will reach 49,200

PJ, 33% below the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final energy demand in

2050 will be 10% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario. The electricity demand for

‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will increase

from 3470 TWh/year in 2015 to around 5230 TWh/year in both alternative scenarios

by 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (9480 TWh/year in 2050), the efficiency

measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios save around 4250 TWh/year by 2050.

Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. In the 2.0  °C Scenario, the electricity demand for heating will be approxi-

mately 2800 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps and in the transport

sector, the electricity demand will be approximately 4200 TWh/year due to electric

mobility. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process

heat) and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an addi-

tional power demand of 3900 TWh/year. Therefore, the gross power demand will

rise from 5900 TWh/year in 2015 to 13,800 TWh/year in 2050  in the 2.0  °C

Scenario, 11% higher than in the 5.0 °C case. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the gross elec-

tricity demand will increase to a maximum of 13,300 TWh/year in 2050.

```
The efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the elec-
```

tricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 24,400 PJ/year and 27,600 PJ/year, respectively, will be avoided

through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.13.1.2 China: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power from renew-

able sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in China will come from

renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—mainly wind,

solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 77% of the total electricity genera-

tion. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 54% by 2030 and

84% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 2170 GW by

2030 and 5420 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity generation in

2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario is assumed to be 63%. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the gen-

eration capacity from renewable energy will be approximately 5310 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.86 shows the development of different renewable technologies in China
```

over time. Figure 8.90 provides an overview of the overall power-generation struc-

ture in China. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and PV, up to

1670 GW and 2220 GW, respectively, will be complemented by up to 680 GW solar

thermal generation, as well as limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean energy, in the

2.0 °C Scenario. Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will lead to a high proportion

of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 28% and 34%, respectively,

by 2030, and 51% and 52%, respectively, by 2050.

**8.13.1.3 China: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.91 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs
over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated elec-
tricity generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 4.7 ct/kWh. In
the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2030, when they reach 9.2
ct/kWh, and then drop to 8.8 ct/kWh by 2050. The generation costs will increase in
the alternative scenarios until 2030, when they reach around 8 ct/kWh, and will then
drop to 6.5 ct/kWh by 2050, 2.3 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C Scenario. Note that
these estimates of generation costs do not take into account integration costs such as
power grid expansion, storage, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 °C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $310 billion/year to more
than $1230 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C case, the total supply costs will be
$1030 billion/year and $1010 billion/year in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Therefore, the
long-term costs for electricity supply will be more than 16% lower in the alternative
scenarios than in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0 °C case to 5.7 ct/kWh in 2030 and stabi-

lize at 5.5 ct/kWh in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, they increase continuously until

2050, when they reach 6.6 ct/kWh. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 7 ct/

kWh and then drop to 6.6 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation

costs will be a maximum of 1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case, and this will

occur in 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, compared to the 5.0 °C Scenario, the maxi-

mum difference in generation costs will be 1.6 ct/kWh in 2040. The generation costs

in 2050 will be 1.1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case. If the CO[^2]: costs are not
considered, the total electricity supply costs in the 5.0  °C case will rise to about

$810 billion/year in 2050.

**8.13.1.4 China: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $9740 billion will be required for power generation
between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants
for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments for plant replace-
ment at the end of their economic lifetimes. This value will be equivalent to approx-
imately $271 billion per year on average and will be $5680 billion more than in the
5.0 °C case ($4060 billion). An investment of around $9840 billion for power gen-
eration will be required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On average,
this will be an investment of $273 billion per year. In the 5.0 °C Scenario, the invest-
ment in conventional power plants will be around 29% of the total cumulative
investments, whereas approximately 71% will be invested in renewable power gen-
eration and co-generation (Fig. 8.92).
However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, China will shift almost 97% (98%) of
its entire investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil fuel share
of the power sector investment will predominantly focus on gas power plants that
can also be operated with hydrogen.
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative
fuel cost savings in both alternative scenarios will reach a total of more than $6200
billion in 2050, equivalent to $173 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost
savings will be equivalent to 110% of the total additional investments compared to
the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.13.1.5 China: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 38%
from 42,300 PJ/year in 2015 to 58,200 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures
will help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 42% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C
Scenario, relative to the 5.0  °C case, and by 47% in the 1.5  °C Scenario. Today,
renewables supply around 11% of China’s final energy demand for heating, with the
main contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 32% of China’s
total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 46% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In
both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.
Figure 8.93 shows the development of different technologies for heating in China
over time, and Table 8.87 provides the resulting renewable heat supply for all sce-
narios. Up to 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor. In the long term, the

[^8]: Energy Scenario Results

366

growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead to a biomass

share of 24% in both alternative scenarios.

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels

in both scenarios. Hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 4100 PJ/year in

the 2.0 °C Scenario and to 4500 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of

electricity for heating will also increase by a factor of 3.7–4 between 2015 and 2050

and electricity for heating will have a final energy share of 27% in 2050 in both the

2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.13.1.6 China: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $2780 billion in the 2.0 °C Scenario (including investments

for the replacement of plants after their economic lifetimes), or approximately $77

billion per year. The largest share of investment in China is assumed to be for heat

pumps (around $1200 billion), followed by solar collectors and geothermal heat

use. The 1.5 °C Scenario assumes an even faster expansion of renewable technolo-

gies. However, the lower heat demand (compared with the 2.0  °C Scenario) will

result in a lower average annual investment of around $67 billion per year

(Table 8.88, Fig. 8.94).

**8.13.1.7 China: Transport**

The energy demand in the transport sector in China is expected to increase in the

5.0 °C Scenario by 107% from around 12,600 PJ/year in 2015 to 26,100 PJ/year in

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes

will save 68% (17,840 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario.

Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in transport demand
will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 76% (or 19,900 PJ/
year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.89, Fig. 8.95).
By 2030, electricity will provide 21% (680 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s
total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 51%
(1170 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 1600 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-
port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual
electricity demand is 860 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a hydro-
gen demand of 1100 PJ/year by 2050.
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0  °C Scenario to a maximum of 1900 PJ/year.
Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based on power-to-liquid will be intro-
duced, with a maximum amount of 560 PJ/year in 2050. Due to the lower overall
energy demand in transport, biofuel use will be reduced in the 1.5 °C Scenario to a
maximum of around 1400 PJ/year. The maximum synthetic fuel demand will
amount to 720 PJ/year.

**8.13.1.8 China: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0 °C Scenario, China’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will increase by 25%, from
9060 Mt. in 2015 to 11,320 Mt. in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures in both

alternative scenarios will cause annual emissions to fall to 1990 Mt. in 2040 in the
2.0 °C Scenario and to 760 Mt. in the 1.5 °C Scenario, with further reductions to
almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions from 2015
until 2050 will add up to 392 Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, the

cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be 174 Gt and 132

Gt, respectively.

Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 56% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 66% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in annual emissions will occur in both alternative scenarios. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario the reduction will be greatest in the ‘Residential and other’ sector, fol-
lowed by ‘Power generation’ and ‘Transport’ sectors (Fig. 8.96).

**8.13.1.9 China: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-
tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.97. In the 2.0 °C
Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 30%, from around 125,000
PJ/year in 2015 to 87,800 PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario, the

overall primary energy demand will decrease by 54% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario

(5.0 °C: 192,300 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand

will be even lower (80,700 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conver-

sion losses will be lower.

Both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios aim to rapidly phase-out coal and oil. This

will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 28% in 2030 and

92% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, renewables will have a

primary energy share of more than 91% in 2050 (including non-energy consump-

tion, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out by

2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and by 2045  in the 1.5  °C Scenario. The cumulative

primary energy consumption of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 570 EJ,

the cumulative coal consumption to about 3000 EJ, and the crude oil consumption

to 1080 EJ.  In contrast, in the 2.0  °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will

amount to 360 EJ, the cumulative coal demand to 1360 EJ, and the cumulative oil

demand to 430 EJ. Even lower fossil fuel use will be achieved in the 1.5 °C Scenario:

440 EJ for natural gas, 930 EJ for coal, and 340 EJ for oil.

**8.13.2 China: Power Sector Analysis**

China has by far the largest power sector of all world regions—about one quarter of

the world’s total electricity generation. China’s National Energy Administration

(NEA) released the _13th Energy Five-Year Plan (FYP)_ in January 2016 (IEA RED

[^2016]:). The FYP that is in force from 2016 to 2020 introduces framework legislation

that defines energy development for the next 5 years in China. In parallel to the main

Energy FYP, there are 14 additional supporting FYPs, such as the Renewable

Energy 13th FYP, the Wind FYP, and the Electricity FYP, which were all released

at about the same time (GWEC-NL [^2018]:). According to the Renewable Energy 13th

FYP, by 2020, the total RE electricity installations will reach 680 GW, with electric-

ity production of 1900 TWh/year This will account for 27% of electricity produc-

tion. The wind power target is set to reach 210 GW by 2020, with electricity

production of 420 TWh, supplying 6% of China’s total electricity demand. The

target for offshore wind is 5 GW by 2020 (GWEC-NL [^2018]:). For other renewable

power-generation technologies, the 2020 targets are 150 GW for solar PV, 10 GW

for concentrated solar power (CSP), 15 GW for bioenergy, and 380 GW for hydro-

power, including 40 GW hydro pump storage (IEA-RED 2016). The renewable tar-

gets are consistent, to large extent, with both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The

onshore wind and solar PV capacities in both scenarios will increase to 50 GW and

are within the current market size range. The targets for the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

Scenarios for CSP, bioenergy, and offshore wind are slightly higher than current

market volumes. However, the first decade of the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will

reflect the existing trends in China’s power sector.

**8.13.2.1 China: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

China’s solar PV and wind power markets are the largest in the world and represent

about half the global annual market for solar PV (in 2017) and a third of the market

for onshore wind. The continued growth of the annual renewable power market—

for all technologies—for the Chinese market will continue to have a significant

impact on other world regions. To implement the project’s 2.0 °C Scenario, the cur-

rent solar PV market in China must remain at the 2017 level, and to achieve the

```

```

```

1.5 °C Scenario, it must double. The onshore wind market must increase by 50%

compared with 2015 for the 2.0 °C Scenario and must triple to meet the 1.5 °C tra-

jectory. All these annual market volumes must be maintained until 2035, before a

moderate reduction in the annual market sizes can occur (Table 8.90).

**8.13.2.2 China: Utilization of Power Generation Capacities**

Across all regions, an interconnection capacity of 10% is assumed for the base year

calculation. The interconnection capacity will increase to 20% by 2030, with no

further increase thereafter. For the entire modelling period, it is assumed that Taiwan

is not connected to any other region. Under the 2.0 °C Scenario, variable renewables

will attain a share of around 30% in all sub-regions, whereas the 1.5 °C Scenario

will lead to shares of over 40% in five of the seven sub-regions (Table 8.91).

```
Table 8.92 shows the results of the capacity factor calculations done under the
```

assumption that variable and dispatchable power plants will have priority access to

the grid and priority dispatch. The average capacity factors for limited dispatchable

power plants will remain at around 30% until 2030 under the 2.0 °C Scenario. This

relatively low factor indicates an overcapacity in China’s power market. The curtail-

ment rates of 20% (REW 1-[^2018]:) and more in 2017—mainly for wind farms—con-

firm this.

**8.13.2.3 China: Development of Load, Generation, and Residual Load**

The load for China is calculated to continue to increase. Table 8.93 shows that the

maximum load will double across all regions. However, the assumed interconnec-

tion rates of 20% are sufficient for the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas significantly higher

interconnection capacities will be required under the 1.5 °C Scenario. By 2050, all

regions will have an oversupply under the 1.5 °C Scenario. This surplus electricity

will be used to produce synthetic fuels and hydrogen. The [R]E 24/7 model does not

interface with other world regions, so surplus generation will result in a negative

residual load.

```
Finally, Table 8.94 provides an overview of the calculated storage and dispatch
```

power requirements in the Chinese region. The calculated hydro pump storage

increase by 2050 is consistent with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan’s requirement for

40 GW additional capacity. Furthermore, curtailment is within the acceptable range,

at significantly below 10% in both scenarios by 2050. Battery capacities must

increase significantly after 2030. The central, southern, and eastern sub-regions of

mainland China have by far the highest storage requirements.

**8.14 OECD Pacific**

**8.14.1 OECD Pacific: Long-Term Energy Pathways**

**8.14.1.1 OECD Pacific: Final Energy demand by Sector**

The future development pathways for OECD Pacific’s final energy demand when
the assumptions on population growth, GDP growth, and energy intensity are com-
bined are shown in Fig. 8.98 for the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and 1.5  °C Scenarios. In the
5.0 °C Scenario, the total final energy demand will decrease by 2%, from the current
20,100 PJ/year to 19,600 PJ/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the final energy
demand will decrease by 46% compared with current consumption and will reach
10,800 PJ/year by 2050. The final energy demand in the 1.5 °C Scenario will reach
10,200 PJ, 49% below the 2015 demand. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the final energy
demand in 2050 will be 6% lower than in the 2.0  °C Scenario. The electricity
demand for ‘classical’ electrical devices (without power-to-heat or e-mobility) will
decrease from 1520 TWh/year in 2015 to 1150 TWh/year in 2050 in both alternative
scenarios. Compared with the 5.0 °C case (1890 TWh/year in 2050), the efficiency
measures in the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will save 740 TWh/year in 2050.
Electrification will lead to a significant increase in the electricity demand by

2050. The 2.0 °C Scenario has an electricity demand for heating of approximately
400 TWh/year due to electric heaters and heat pumps, and in the transport sector,

the electricity demand will be approximately 1100 TWh/year due to electric mobil-

ity. The generation of hydrogen (for transport and high-temperature process heat)

and the manufacture of synthetic fuels (mainly for transport) will add an additional

power demand of 1000 TWh/year. Therefore, the gross power demand will rise

from 1900 TWh/year in 2015 to 3000 TWh/year in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario,

25% higher than in the 5.0  °C case. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, the gross electricity

demand will increase to a maximum of 3400 TWh/year in 2050.

```
The efficiency gains in the heating sector could be even larger than in the elec-
```

tricity sector. In the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, a final energy consumption equiva-

lent to about 3000 PJ/year and 3100 PJ/year, respectively, will be avoided by 2050

through efficiency gains compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

**8.14.1.2 OECD Pacific: Electricity Generation**

The development of the power system is characterized by a dynamically growing

renewable energy market and an increasing proportion of total power coming from

renewable sources. By 2050, 100% of the electricity produced in OECD Pacific will

come from renewable energy sources in the 2.0 °C Scenario. ‘New’ renewables—

mainly wind, solar, and geothermal energy—will contribute 82% of total electricity

generation. Renewable electricity’s share of the total production will be 60% by

2030 and 89% by 2040. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about 680

GW by 2030 and 1420 GW by 2050. The share of renewable electricity generation

in 2030 in the 1.5 °C Scenario is assumed to be 68%. The 1.5 °C Scenario will have

a generation capacity from renewable energy of approximately 1590 GW in 2050.

```
Table 8.95 shows the development of different renewable technologies in OECD
```

Pacific over time. Figure 8.99 provides an overview of the overall power-generation

structure in OECD Pacific. From 2020 onwards, the continuing growth of wind and

PV, up to 320 GW and 830 GW, respectively, will complemented by up to 60 GW

solar thermal generation, as well as limited biomass, geothermal, and ocean energy,

in the 2.0  °C Scenario. Both the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios will lead to a high

proportion of variable power generation (PV, wind, and ocean) of 40% and 47% by

2030, respectively, and of 68% in both scenarios by 2050.

**8.14.1.3 OECD Pacific: Future Costs of Electricity Generation**

Figure 8.100 shows the development of the electricity-generation and supply costs

over time, including the CO[^2]: emission costs, in all scenarios. The calculated
electricity-generation costs in 2015 (referring to full costs) were around 8 ct/kWh.

In the 5.0 °C case, the generation costs will increase until 2030, when they reach
11.1 ct/kWh, and then drop to 10.9 ct/kWh by 2050. The generation costs will
increase in the 2.0 °C Scenario until 2030, when they reach 10.5 ct/kWh, and then
drop to 8.3 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will increase to 10.7 ct/
kWh, and then drop to 8.5 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the generation

costs in 2050 will be 2.6 ct/kWh lower than in the 5.0 °C case, and in the 1.5 °C
Scenario, this difference will 2.4 ct/kWh. Note that these estimates of generation
costs do not take into account integration costs such as power grid expansion, stor-
age, or other load-balancing measures.
In the 5.0 ° C case, the growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel prices will
cause the total electricity supply costs to rise from today’s $160 billion/year to more
than $270 billion/year in 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, the total supply costs will be
$270 billion/year, and in the 1.5  °C Scenario, they will be $310 billion/year. The
long-term costs for electricity supply will be only 2% higher in the 2.0 °C Scenario
than in the 5.0  °C Scenario as a result of the estimated generation costs and the
electrification of heating and mobility. Further electrification and synthetic fuel gen-
eration in the 1.5  °C Scenario will result in total power generation costs that are
17% higher than in the 5.0 °C case.
Compared with these results, the generation costs when the CO[^2]: emission costs
are not considered will increase in the 5.0 °C case to 8.3 ct/kWh in 2050. The gen-

eration costs in the 2.0 °C Scenario will increase until 2030, when they will reach

9.3 ct/kWh, and then drop to 8.3 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, they will

increase to 9.9 ct/kWh, and then drop to 8.5 ct/kWh by 2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario,

the generation costs will be a maximum of 1 ct/kWh higher than in the 5.0 °C case

and this will occur in 2040. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, compared with the 5.0  °C

Scenario, the maximum difference in the generation costs will be 1.4 ct/kWh, again

in 2040. If the CO[^2]: costs are not considered, the total electricity supply costs in the
5.0 °C case will rise to about $200 billion/year in 2050.

**8.14.1.4 OECD Pacific: Future Investments in the Power Sector**

An investment of around $2780 billion will be required for power generation

between 2015 and 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario—including additional power plants

for the production of hydrogen and synthetic fuels and investments in the replace-

ment of plants at the end of their economic lifetimes. This value will be equivalent

to approximately $77 billion per year on average, and will be $1520 billion more

than in the 5.0 °C case ($1260 billion). An investment of around $3100 billion for

power generation will required between 2015 and 2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario. On

average, this is an investment of $86 billion per year. In the 5.0  °C Scenario, the

investment in conventional power plants will be around 56% of the total cumulative

investments, whereas approximately 44% will be invested in renewable power gen-

eration and co-generation (Fig. 8.101).

However, in the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario, OECD Pacific will shift almost 93%

(95%) of its entire investment to renewables and co-generation. By 2030, the fossil

fuel share of the power sector investment will predominantly focused on gas power

plants that can also be operated with hydrogen.

Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, other than biomass, the cumulative

fuel cost savings in the 2.0 °C Scenario will reach a total of $1420 billion in 2050,

equivalent to $39 billion per year. Therefore, the total fuel cost savings will be

equivalent to 90% of the total additional investments compared to the 5.0  °C

Scenario. The fuel cost savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario will add up to $1510 billion,

or $42 billion per year.

**8.14.1.5 OECD Pacific: Energy Supply for Heating**

The final energy demand for heating will increase in the 5.0 °C Scenario by 17%,

from 7100 PJ/year in 2015 to 8300 PJ/year in 2050. Energy efficiency measures will

help to reduce the energy demand for heating by 35% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario,

relative to the 5.0 °C case, and by 37% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. Today, renewables

supply around 7% of OECD Pacific’s final energy demand for heating, with the main

contribution from biomass. Renewable energy will provide 33% of OECD Pacific’s

total heat demand in 2030 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 42% in the 1.5 °C Scenario. In

both scenarios, renewables will provide 100% of the total heat demand in 2050.

```
Figure 8.102 shows the development of different technologies for heating in
```

OECD Pacific over time, and Table 8.96 provides the resulting renewable heat sup-

ply for all scenarios. Up to 2030, biomass will remain the main contributor. The

growing use of solar, geothermal, and environmental heat will lead, in the long term,

to a biomass share of 37% in the 2.0 °C Scenario and of 35% in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

Heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels

in both scenarios. The hydrogen consumption in 2050 will be around 700 PJ/year in

the 2.0 °C Scenario and 800 PJ/year in the 1.5 °C Scenario. The direct use of elec-

tricity for heating will also increases by a factor of 1.6 between 2015 and 2050, and

will achieves a final energy share of 21% in 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 22% in

the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**8.14.1.6 OECD Pacific: Future Investments in the Heating Sector**

The roughly estimated investments in renewable heating technologies up to 2050

will amount to around $530 billion in the 2.0  °C Scenario (including the invest-

ments for the replacement of plants after their economic lifetimes), or approxi-

mately $15 billion per year. The largest share of the investment in OECD Pacific is

**8.14.1.7 OECD Pacific: Transport**

Energy demand in the transport sector in OECD Pacific is expected to decrease by

37% in the 5.0 °C Scenario, from around 6200 PJ/year in 2015 to 3900 PJ/year in

2050. In the 2.0 °C Scenario, assumed technical, structural, and behavioural changes

will save 49% (around 1900 PJ/year) by 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C Scenario.

Additional modal shifts, technology switches, and a reduction in the transport

demand will lead to even higher energy savings in the 1.5 °C Scenario of 59% (or

2300 PJ/year) in 2050 compared with the 5.0 °C case (Table 8.98, Fig. 8.104).

By 2030, electricity will provide 20% (200 TWh/year) of the transport sector’s

total energy demand in the 2.0 °C Scenario, whereas in 2050, the share will be 53%

(300 TWh/year). In 2050, up to 480 PJ/year of hydrogen will be used in the trans-

port sector as a complementary renewable option. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the annual

electricity demand will be 240 TWh in 2050. The 1.5 °C Scenario also assumes a

hydrogen demand of 360 PJ/year by 2050.

```
Biofuel use is limited in the 2.0 °C Scenario and the 1.5 °C Scenario to a maxi-
```

mum of approximately 200 PJ/year. Therefore, around 2030, synthetic fuels based

on power-to-liquid will be introduced, with a maximum amount of 270 PJ/year in

2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario. Due to the lower overall energy demand in transport,

the maximum synthetic fuel demand will amount to 210  PJ/year in the 1.5  °C

Scenario.

**8.14.1.8 OECD Pacific: Development of CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

In the 5.0  °C Scenario, OECD Pacific’s annual CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by
21%, from 2080 Mt in 2015 to 1640 Mt in 2050. The stringent mitigation measures
in both alternative scenarios will cause the annual emissions to fall to 280  Mt in
2040  in the 2.0  °C Scenario and to 160 Mt. in the 1.5  °C Scenario, with further
reductions to almost zero by 2050. In the 5.0 °C case, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions
from 2015 until 2050 will add up to 67  Gt. In contrast, in the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C
Scenarios, the cumulative emissions for the period from 2015 until 2050 will be
31 Gt and 26 Gt, respectively.
Therefore, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions will decrease by 54% in the 2.0  °C
Scenario and by 61% in the 1.5 °C Scenario compared with the 5.0 °C case. A rapid
reduction in the annual emissions will occur under both alternative scenarios. In the
2.0 °C Scenario, this reduction will be greatest in ‘Power generation’, followed by
‘Transport’ and ‘Industry’ (Fig. 8.105).

**8.14.1.9 OECD Pacific: Primary Energy Consumption**

The levels of primary energy consumption in the three scenarios when the assump-

tions discussed above are taken into account are shown in Fig. 8.106. In the 2.0 °C

Scenario, the primary energy demand will decrease by 48%, from around 36,300 PJ/

year in 2015 to 18,900  PJ/year in 2050. Compared with the 5.0  °C Scenario, the

overall primary energy demand will decrease by 45% by 2050 in the 2.0 °C Scenario

(5.0 °C: 34,700 PJ in 2050). In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the primary energy demand will

be even lower (19,900 PJ in 2050) because the final energy demand and conversion

losses will be lower.

Both the 2.0 °C Scenario and 1.5 °C Scenario aim to rapidly phase-out coal and

oil. This will cause renewable energy to have a primary energy share of 33% in 2030

and 88% in 2050  in the 2.0  °C Scenario. In the 1.5  °C Scenario, renewables will

have a primary energy share of more than 89% in 2050 (including non-energy con-

sumption, which will still include fossil fuels). Nuclear energy will be phased-out in

2040 in both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. The cumulative primary energy con-

sumption of natural gas in the 5.0 °C case will add up to 230 EJ, the cumulative coal

consumption to about 300 EJ, and the crude oil consumption to 380 EJ. In contrast,

in the 2.0 °C Scenario, the cumulative gas demand will amount to 150 EJ, the cumu-

lative coal demand to 100 EJ, and the cumulative oil demand to 230 EJ. Even lower

for coal, and 190 EJ for oil.

**8.14.2 OECD Pacific: Power Sector Analysis**

South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand form the OECD Pacific region
(also referred to as OECD Asia Pacific or OECD Asia Oceania). Like Non-OECD
Asia, a regional interconnected power market with regular electricity exchange is
unlikely. Therefore, the region is broken down into seven sub-regions: (1) South
Korea; (2) the north of Japan; (3) the south of Japan; (4) Australia’s National
Electricity Market (NEM) (covering the entire east coast); (5) the SWIS-NT grid
region (comprising Western Australia and the Northern Territory); (6) the North
Island of New Zealand; and (7) the South Island of New Zealand. The sub-regions
have very different electricity policies, power-generation structures, and demand
patterns. In this analysis, simplifications that may not reflect the local conditions are
made to ensure that the results comparable on a global level. Therefore, the results
for specific countries are only estimates.

**8.14.2.1 OECD Pacific: Development of Power Plant Capacities**

The region has significant potential for all renewables, including the dominant
renewable power technologies of solar PV and onshore wind. Japan has significant
geothermal power resources, and offshore wind potentials are substantial across the
region. There is also potential for ocean energy across the region, although it is cur-
rently a niche technology. Australia has one of the best solar resources in the world,
so concentrated solar power plants will be an important part of both scenarios in
Australia. Coal and nuclear capacities will be phased-out as plants come to the end
of their lifetimes. In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the last coal power plant will be phased out
just after 2030.
The solar PV market will reach 8 GW in 2020 under the 2.0 °C Scenario—the
same level as the actual regional market of 8.3 GW (REN21-GSR [^2018]:) in 2017—
and increase rapidly to 43 GW by 2030. The 1.5 °C Scenario requires that solar PV
will achieve an equal market size by 2030 and remain at this level until 2040.
However, the onshore market must increase significantly compared with the mar-

ket in 2017, which was only 0.54 GW (GWEC-NL [^2018]:). By 2025, 12  GW of

onshore wind capacity must be installed annually across the region under the 2.0 °C

```

```

```

Scenario, and 17 GW under the 1.5 °C Scenario. By 2030, geothermal, concentrated

solar power, and ocean energy must increase by around 2 GW each (Table 8.99).

**8.14.2.2 OECD Pacific: Utilization of Power Generation Capacities**

The very different developments of variable and dispatch power plants in all sub-

regions reflect the diversity the Pacific region. Table 8.100 shows that because there

is no interconnection between the northern and southern parts of Japan, we assume

that even within Japan, the separate electricity markets of the 50  Hz and 60  Hz

regions will remain as they are. For Australia, it is assumed that the east- and west-

coast electricity markets will have limited interconnection capacities by 2030. The

North and South Islands of New Zealand are calculated to have an increased inter-

connection capacity by 2050.

```
Table 8.101 shows that for the region as a whole, the limited dispatchable power
```

plants will retain a relatively high capacity factor, compared with other regions,

until after 2020 and decrease thereafter. The average capacity factors from 2030

onwards will be consistent with all other regions.

**8.14.2.3 OECD Pacific: Development of Load, Generation,**

**and Residual Load**

Table 8.102 shows the development of the maximum load, generation, and resulting

residual load in the Pacific region. To verify the calculation results, we compared

the peak demands in Australia and Japan.

The peak load for Australia’s NEM was calculated to be 32.6 GW in 2020, which

corresponds to the reported summer peak of 32.5 GW in the summer of 2017/2018

(AER [^2018]:). Japan’s peak demand was 152  GW in 2015 according to the Tokyo

Electric Power Company (TEPCO -[^2018]:) and TEPCO predicts that it will be

136 GW in 2020, which is 11% lower.

In the long term, the Pacific region will be a renewable fuel producer for the

export market. Therefore, the calculated increased interconnection capacities indi-

cate overproduction, which will be used for international bunker fuels.

The storage and dispatch requirements for all sub-regions are shown in

Table 8.103. The Pacific region has vast solar and wind resources and will therefore

be one of the production hubs for synthetic fuels and hydrogen, which may be used

for industrial processes, for bunker fuels, or to replace natural gas. Therefore, the

storage and dispatch demand may vary significantly because they depend on the

extent to which renewable fuel production is integrated into the national power sec-

tors or used for dispatch and demand-side management. The more integrated the

fuel production is, the lower the overall requirement for battery or hydro pump stor-

age technologies. Further research is required to develop a dedicated plan to pro-

duce renewable bunker fuels in Australia.

#### Trajectories for a Just Transition

#### of the Fossil Fuel Industry

**Sven Teske**

**Abstract** This section provides historical production data for coal, oil and gas

between 1980 and 2015. The 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenario lead to specific phase-out

pathways for each of the fossil fuel types. Current regional production volumes are

compared with future demands. The results provide the input for the employment

analysis in the following chapter for the fossil fuel sector. This section discusses the

need to shift the current political debate about coal, oil and gas which is focused on

security of supply and price security towards an open debate about an orderly with-

drawal from coal, oil and gas extraction industries.

The implementation of the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate mitigation pathways presented

here will have a significant impact on the global fossil fuel industry. Although this

may appear to be stating the obvious, current climate debates have not yet involved

open discussion of the orderly withdrawal from the coal, oil, and gas extraction

industries. Instead, the political debate about coal, oil, and gas has focused on the

security of supply and price security. However, mitigating climate change is only

possible when fossil fuels are phased-out. This section provides an overview of the

time-frame of this phase-out under the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios compared with

the 5.0 °C pathway.

**9.1 Fossil Energy Resources—The Sky Is the Limit**

An unrelenting increase in fossil fuel extraction conflicts with the finite nature of

these resources. At the same time, the global distribution of oil and gas resources

does not match the distribution of demand. Therefore, some countries currently rely

almost entirely on imported fossil fuels. Therefore, is the relative scarcity of fossil

fuels an additional reason an energy transition? The Global Energy Assessment

(GEA [^2012]:), an integrated assessment of the global energy system, has published a

comprehensive overview of estimated available fossil fuel reserves and resources.

Table 9.1 shows the estimates for conventional and unconventional coal, oil, and gas

reserves and resources. The distinction between reserves and resources is based on

the current technology (exploration and production) and market conditions. The

resource data are not cumulative and do not include reserves (GEA 2012).

The assessment shows that there is no shortage of fossil fuels. There might be a

shortage of conventional oil and gas, but unconventional resources are still signifi-

cantly larger than our climate can cope with. Reducing global fossil fuel consump-

tion for reasons of resource scarcity alone is not essential, even though there may be

substantial price fluctuations and regional or structural shortages, as we have seen

in the past (Teske and Pregger [^2015]:).

**9.2 Coal—Past Production and Future Trajectories**

**Under Three Scenarios**

Global coal production is dominated by China, which in 2017, produced over 3.5

billion tonnes of coal, 45% of the world volume, followed by India with 716 million

tonnes, the USA with 702 million tons, and Australia with 481 million tons. The top

10 producers, in order of annual production, are China, India, USA, Australia,

Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Germany (mainly lignite), Poland,

and Kazakhstan. These countries account for 90% of the global coal production.

```
Figure 9.1 shows the historical time series for global coal production. The data
```

are based on the BP Statistical Review 2018 (BP [^2018]:), as are the following over-

views of oil and gas. Production volumes have declined in recent years, mainly due

to changes in demand in China, but they rose again in 2017.

Under the 5.0  °C scenario, the required production of thermal coal (excluding

coal for non-energy uses, such as steel production) will remain at the 2015 level,

with an annual increase of around 1% per year until 2050. As shown in Fig. 9.2,

under the 2.0 °C Scenario, coal production will decline sharply between 2020 and

2030 at a rate of around 6% per year. By 2030, the global coal production will be

equal to China’s annual production in 2017, at 3.7 billion tons, whereas that volume

will be reached in 2025 under the 1.5 °C Scenario.

**9.3 Oil—Past Production and Future Trajectories**

**Under the Three Scenarios**

Oil production almost doubled between 1965 and 1975. After the early 1990s, it

grew almost constantly and by 2017, the production volume was about three times

higher than in 1965 and twice as high as in 1985 (Fig. 9.3). Unlike coal, there is no

sign of a decline in oil production in response to reduced demand. Oil production is

more widely distributed than coal production. Three countries, the USA, Russia,

and Saudi Arabia, have global market shares of around 12–14% each, whereas four

countries, Canada, Iran, Iraq, and China, produce around 5% each. The other oil-

producing countries have significantly lower market shares.

```
Figure 9.4 shows the global oil production levels required by the three calculated
```

scenarios. Oil for non-energy uses, such as the petrochemical industry, is not

included in this graph. Again, oil production in the 5.0  °C Scenario will grow

steadily by 1% until the end of the modelling period in 2050. Under the 2.0  °C

Scenario, oil production will decline by 5% per year until 2030 and by 3% annually

until 2025. After 2030, production will decline by around 7% per year, on average,

until oil production for energy is phased-out entirely. The oil production capacity of

the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Russia in 2017 would be sufficient to supply the global

demand calculated for the 2.0 °C Scenario in 2035. The 1.5 °C Scenario will cut the

required production volumes in half by 2030, reducing them further to the equivalent

of the production volume of just one of the three largest oil producers (the USA,

Saudi Arabia, or Russia) by 2040.

**9.4 Gas—Past Production and Future Trajectories**
**Under the Three Scenarios**

Gas production has grown steadily over the past four decades, leading to an overall
production of 3500 billion cubic meters—3.5 times higher than in 1970. The pro-
duction of natural gas is even more widely distributed than oil production. According
to 2017 figures, by far the largest producers are the USA, with 20% of the global
volume, and Russia with 17%. Four countries have market share of around 5% each:
Canada (4.8%), Iran (6.1%), Qatar (4.8%), and China (4.1%). The remaining 43%
of global gas production is distributed over 42 countries (Fig. 9.5).
In the 5.0 °C Scenario, gas production will increase steadily by 2% a year for the
next two decades, leading to an overall production increase of about 50% by 2050.
Compared with coal and oil, the gas phase-out will be significantly slower in the
2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios. Furthermore, these scenarios assume that infrastruc-
ture, such as gas pipelines and power plants, will be used after this phase-out for
hydrogen and/or renewable methane produced with electricity from renewable
sources (see Chap. [^5]:, Sect 5.2). Under the 2.0 °C Scenario, gas production will only
decrease by 0.2% per year until 2025, then by 1% until 2030, and on average by 4%
annually until 2040. This represents a rather slow phase-out and will allow the gas
industry to gradually transfer to hydrogen. The phase-out under the 1.5 °C Scenario
will be equally slow, and a 4%/year reduction will occur after 2025 (Fig. 9.6).

**9.5 Overview: Required Fossil Fuel Resources**

**Under the 5.0 °C, 2.0 °C, and 1.5 °C Trajectories**

In summary, the global fossil fuel extraction industry must reduce production at a

rate of 2% per annum under the 2.0 °C Scenario and 3% per annum under the 1.5 °C

Scenario. A constant reduction in production seems unlikely if no international

measures are taken to organize the economic and social transitions in the producing

countries, and for the communities and workers involved. The idea of a ‘just transi-

tion’ is well documented in the international literature. According to the International

Labour Organization (ILO [^2015]:), the concept was first mentioned in the 1990s,

when North American unions began developing the concept of just transition.

Initially, trade unionists understood ‘just transition’ to be a program of support

for workers who lost their jobs due to environmental protection policies. Since then,

several UNFCCC Climate Conferences have referred to the ‘just transition’ con-

cept. The Paris Climate Agreement 2015, during the 21st session of the Conference

of the Parties (COP 21) “_decided to continue and improve the forum on the impact_

_of the implementation of response measures (hereinafter referred to as the improved_

_forum), and adopted the work programme, comprising two areas: (1) economic_

_diversification and transformation; and (2) just transition of the workforce, and the_

_creation of decent work and quality jobs_” (UNFCCC-JT [^2016]:).

```
Table 9.2 provides possible trajectories for global coal, oil, and gas production,
```

consistent with the Paris Agreement targets. These trajectories are the results of the

2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios, documented in detail over the previous six chapters of

this book. Chapter [^10]: uses these trajectories to calculate possible employment

effects, both in terms of job losses in the fossil fuel industry, job gains in the renew-

able energy industry, and options for transitioning the gas industry towards a renew-

ably produced hydrogen industry.

**Abstract** This section provides the input data for two different employment devel-

opment calculation methods: The quantitative analysis, which looks into the overall

number of jobs in renewable and fossil fuel industries and the occupational analysis

which looks into specific job categories required for the solar and wind sector as

well as the oil, gas, and coal industry. Results are given with various figures and

tables.

**10.1 Introduction: Employment Modelling for a Just**

**Transition**

The transition to a 100% renewable energy system is not just a technical task. It is

also a socially and economically challenging process, and it is imperative that the

transition is managed in a fair and equitable way. One of the key concerns is the

employment of workers in the affected industries (UNFCCC [^2016]:; ILO [^2015]:).

However, it should be noted that the ‘just transition’ concept is concerned not only

with workers’ rights, but also with the well-being of the broader community (Smith

[^2017]:; Jenkins et al. [^2016]:; Sovacool and Dworkin [^2014]:). This includes, for example,

community participation in decision-making processes, public dialogue, and policy

mechanisms to create an enabling environment for new industries, to ensure local

economic development.

Although it is acknowledged that a just transition is important, there are limited

data on the impacts that the transition will have on employment. There is even less

information on the types of occupations that will be affected by the transition, either

by project growth or a decline in employment. This study provides projections for

jobs in construction, manufacturing, operations and maintenance (O&M), and fuel

and heat supply across 12 technologies and 10 world regions, based on the energy

jobs by specific occupations. Projected employment is calculated regionally, but in
this chapter, we present an overview of the global data, which are an aggregate of the
results for the 10 world regions. Further details, including a further regional break-
down of employment data, are provided in the full report (Dominish et al. [^2018]:).

**10.2 Quantitative Employment Modelling**

This section discusses the calculation factors used for the quantitative employment

modelling (an overview of the methodology is given in Sect. 3.6 of Chap. [^3]:). The

factors were analysed on a regional basis where possible, to take into account the

significant economic differences between world regions. The results are then pre-

sented in the following section.

**10.2.1 Employment Factors**

Employment factors were used to calculate the number of jobs required per unit of

electrical or heating capacity, or per unit of fuel. The employment factors differ

depending on whether they involve manufacturing, construction, operation and

maintenance, or fuel supply. Information about these factors usually comes from

OECD countries because that is where most data are collected, although local data

were used wherever possible. For job calculations in non-OECD regions, regional

adjustments were made when a local factor was not available (see Sect. 10.2.2). The

employment factors used in the calculations are shown in Table 10.1.

The employment factors were based on coal supplies, because employment per

tonne varies significantly across the world regions and because coal plays a signifi-

cant role in energy production in many countries. In Australia and the USA, coal is

extracted at an average rate of more than 9000 tonnes per person per year, whereas

in Europe, the average coal miner is responsible for less than 1000 tonnes per year.

China has relatively low per capita productivity at present, with 650  tonnes per

worker per year, but the annual increases in productivity are very high. India and

Eurasia have significantly increased their productivity since a similar analysis was

performed in 2015. Local data were also used for gas extraction in every region

except India, the Middle East, and Non-OECD-Asia. The calculation of coal and

gas employment per petajoule (PJ) drew on data from national statistics and com-

pany reports, combined with production figures from the BP Statistical Review of

World Energy 2018 (BP-SR 2018) or other sources. Data were collected for as

many major coal-producing countries as possible, and coverage was obtained for

90% of the world coal production (Table 10.2).

**10.2.2 Regional Adjustments**

The employment factors used in this model for energy technologies other than coal
mining were usually for OECD regions, which are typically wealthier than other
regions. A regional multiplier was applied to make the jobs per MW more realistic
for other parts of the world. In developing countries, there are generally more jobs
per unit of electricity because those countries have more labour-intensive practices.
The multipliers change over the study period, consistent with the projections for
GDP per worker. This reflects the fact that as prosperity increases, labour intensity
tends to fall. The multipliers are shown in Table 10.3.

**10.2.2.1 Local Employment Factors**

Local employment factors were used where possible. These region-specific factors
were:

• _OECD Americas—_gas and coal fuel, photovoltaics (PV) and offshore wind (all
factors), and solar thermal power (construction and operation and maintenance
(O&M)
• _OECD Europe—_gas and coal fuel, offshore wind (all factors), solar thermal
power (construction and O&M), and solar heating
• _OECD Pacific—_gas and coal fuel
• _Africa_—gas, coal, and biomass fuel
• _China—_gas and coal fuel, and solar heating
• _Eastern Europe/Eurasia—_gas and coal fuel
• _Developing Asia_—coal fuel
• _India_ – coal fuel and solar heating
• _Latin America—_coal and biomass fuels, onshore wind (all factors), nuclear (con-
struction and O&M), large hydro (O&M), and small hydro (construction and
O&M).

**10.2.2.2 Local Manufacturing and Fuel Production**

Some regions do not manufacture the equipment (e.g., wind turbines or solar PV

panels) required for the introduction of renewable technologies. This model includes

estimates of the percentages of renewable technology that are made locally and

assumes that the percentage of local manufacturing will increase over time as the

industry matures. Based on this, the jobs involving the manufacture of components

for export were calculated for the region in which the manufacturing occurs. The

same applies to coal and gas, because they are traded internationally, so the jobs in

fuel supply were calculated regionally, based on historical data.

**10.2.2.3 Learning Adjustments or ‘Decline Factors’**

Learning adjustments are used to account for the projected reductions in the costs of

renewables over time, as technologies and companies become more efficient and

production processes are scaled up. Generally, jobs per MW are projected to fall in

parallel with this trend. The cost projections for each of the calculated energy sce-

nario regions (see Sect. 5.3 of Chap. [^5]:) were used to derive these factors.

**10.2.3 Results of Quantitative Employment Modelling**

The 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios will result in an increase in energy-sector jobs in

the world as a whole at every stage of the projection. The 1.5  °C Scenario will

increase the renewable energy capacities faster, so employment will increase faster

than in the 2.0 °C Scenario. By 2050, employment in te energy sector will be within

the same range in both scenarios, at around 48–50 million jobs.

• In 2025, there will be 29.6 million energy-sector jobs in the 5.0  °C Scenario,

42.3 million in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and 48.1 million in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

• In 2030, there will be 30.3 million energy-sector jobs in the 5.0  °C Scenario,

49.2 million in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and 53.8 million in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

• In 2050, there will be 29.6 million energy-sector jobs in the 5.0  °C Scenario,

50.4 million in the 2.0 °C Scenario, and 47.8 million in the 1.5 °C Scenario.

```
Figure 10.1 shows the changes in job numbers under the 5.0  °C, 2.0  °C, and
```

1.5 °C Scenarios for each technology between 2015 and 2030. the 5.0 °C Scenario,

jobs will drop to 4% below the 2015 levels by 2020 and then remain quite stable

until 2030. Strong growth in renewable energy will lead to an increase of 44% in the

total energy-sector jobs in the 2.0 °C Scenario and 66% in the 1.5 °C Scenario by

2025. In the 2.0 °C (1.5 °C) Scenario the renewable energy sector will account for

81% (86%) in 2025 and 87% (89%) in 2030, with PV having the greatest share of

24% (26%), followed by biomass, wind, and solar heating.

**10.3 Occupational Employment Modelling**

To plan for a just transition, it is important to understand the occupations and loca-
tions at which jobs are likely to be lost or created. The modelling of employment by
type of occupation is based on a new framework developed by UTS/ISF and financed
by the German Greenpeace Foundation. The framework is applied to the results of
the employment modelling discussed in Sect. 10.2. This information can be used to
attempt to understand where labour is likely to be required in the renewable energy
transition, and where job losses are likely to occur.

**10.3.1 Background: Development of Occupational**
**Employment Modelling**

The occupational employment modelling framework used in this study was devel-
oped for renewable energy (solar PV, onshore wind, offshore wind) and fossil fuels
(coal and gas). The three primary studies that classified and measured the occupa-
tional composition of renewable energy industries were conducted by the
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Through surveys of around 45
industry participants across a range of developed and developing nations, IRENA
estimated the percentages of person–days for the various occupations across the
solar PV and onshore and offshore wind farm supply chains (IRENA 2017a, b,

[^2018]:). Figure 10.2 is an example (in this case, for solar PV manufacturing).

```
IRENA’s studies are the most detailed estimates of the occupational composi-
```

tions of the solar PV and onshore wind industries to date. ISF has extended the

application of IRENA’s work in two key ways:

1. **Mapping IRENA’s job categories against the International Standard**

```
Classification of Occupations (ISCO): IRENA uses its own occupational clas-
sification system, which does not match the ISCO, which is the basis for national
statistical agency data. For example, ‘regulation and standardization experts’ is
not a category in the ISCO. Consequently, the IRENA job categories have been
mapped and translated across to the ISCO to facilitate comparisons between
renewable energy technologies and fossil fuel sectors. The best fit for each of the
occupations in the IRENA studies has been identified at one-digit, two-digit,
three-digit, and four-digit levels of the ISCO.
```

2. **Unpacking mid- and low-skill job categories in IRENA’s study**: Some of the

```
categories in the IRENA studies containe jobs that are of interest from a just
transition perspective. Specifically, IRENA combines:
```

• ‘Factory workers’ for solar PV and onshore and offshore wind
manufacturing
• ‘Ship crews’ for offshore wind construction and operation and maintenance
• ‘Construction workers’ for solar PV, onshore wind farm construction, and
operation and maintenance.

[^10]: Just Transition: Employment Projections for the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios

420

These categories combine a range of technicians, trades, machinery operators,

drivers, and assemblers, and labourers.

```
For factory workers, industry data from the Benchmarks of Global Clean Energy
```

_Manufacturing_ study by the Clean Energy Manufacturing Analysis Centre was

combined with the occupational framework from the Australian census. The inter-

national standard classification of industries used for the Benchmarks of Global

Clean Energy Manufacturing study were translated across to the Australian New

Zealand Standard Classification of Industry framework (which is based on the inter-

national classification standard) (Australian Bureau of Statistics & Statistics New

Zealand [^2013]:).

```
Data from the Australian census on the occupational composition of these manu-
```

facturing sectors were then used to derive the breakdown of employment (Australian

Bureau of Statistics [^2017]:). The census includes a comprehensive stocktake of

employment, with data at one-, two-, three- and four-digit levels for each industry.

The Australian–New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations is based on

the ISCO. Clean Energy Manufacturing Analysis data on the relative share of the

value added by component was used to weight the shares of employment. The

Australian manufacturing sectors used are not wind or solar PV manufacturing

activities, but as the Clean Energy Manufacturing Analysis Centre notes, ‘Large

portions of the wind energy supply chain connect well to core manufacturing indus-

tries’ (CEMAC [^2017]:). To clarify construction worker categories for onshore wind
and PV construction, and for the operation and maintenance of solar PV, interviews
were conducted with project managers who were currently overseeing or had
recently completed construction projects (Table 10.4).
The IRENA studies are the richest data source on employment in solar PV and
onshore wind projects, but further work is required to directly match renewable
energy job levels against existing fossil fuel sectors and to generate data on mid- and
low-skill jobs, which are of primary interest from a just transition perspective.
As an example, Table 10.5 shows the occupational hierarchy for solar PV con-
struction and how it is matched against ISCO. ISCO classifies occupations from a
one-digit level (left) to a four-digit level (right). Each level is more detailed than the
previous one in terms of the labour force required for the type of work. This meth-
odology has been transferred to an occupational hierarchy that has been constructed
for solar PV, onshore wind, and offshore wind using IRENA and other data sources
to map jobs against the ISCO. The result is a matrix with percentages allocated to
each occupation at the one-, two-, three-, and four-digit levels of aggregation.
The framework for fossil fuels was derived from labour statistics from the
Australian 2016 national census for coal mining, gas supply, and coal and gas gen-
eration (Australian Bureau of Statistics [^2017]:). Although these data are specific to
Australia, these statistics provide the best source of data, and regional multipliers in
the quantitative modelling can adjust the results to account for economic differences
between regions.

10 Just Transition: Employment Projections for the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios
```

424

For each modelling run, the results for the installed capacity of the renewable

energy technologies (MW) and full-time-equivalent jobs (FTE/MW) were used to

generate an aggregate level of employment for construction, manufacturing, and

operation and maintenance. The matrix was then used to calculate the number of

jobs at different levels of disaggregation (Sect. 3.6.1.)

```
The final framework is shown in Table 10.4. This is based on a composite profile
```

for each technology using a mix of one-, two-, three-, and four-digit levels of occu-

pation, depending on which best illustrates the breakdown of jobs and allows com-

parison to be made across technologies. Choices have been made based on the

proportion of jobs and the labels that are most readily understandable to readers

(noting that the categories used in the ISCO do not always correspond to popularly

used titles). Note, for example, that ‘Managers’ is a one-digit category, but trades

are broken down into construction trades, metal trades, and electricians because this

provides more meaningful descriptions.

```
In the example shown in Table 10.6, it is notable that wind and solar farms
```

employ higher proportions of professionals and technicians for their operations and

maintenance than coal mining, and similar or higher proportions of elementary

occupations, but much lower proportions of machinery operators and drivers.

**10.3.1.1 Methodology and Limitations**

• At the aggregate level, it is assumed that rising labour productivity over time will

```
reduce the labour intensity (i.e., less FTE/MW) that is applied in the construc-
tion, manufacture, and operation and maintenance of each renewable energy
technology. No assumptions have been made about changes to the relative labour
intensity between occupations. Over time, we would expect that the proportion
of less-skilled jobs would fall as a result of mechanization. Therefore, the share
of less-skilled jobs is likely to be overestimated.
```

• IRENA estimates a single global figure for each occupation, averaged from sur-

```
veys of industry participants across different global markets. In practice, there
are variations in labour intensity and the compositions of jobs across supply
chains between different regions (broadly speaking, supply chains in lower-wage
nations are more labour intensive). ISF takes account of regional conditions in
the job factors applied at the level of major sub-sectors (construction, manufac-
turing, operation and maintenance), but not at the disaggregated level. Therefore,
it is likely that the proportion of less-skilled jobs is overestimated for rich econo-
mies and underestimated for less-developed economies.
```

• The breakdown of the category of ‘construction workers’ is based on interviews

```
with some Australian solar and wind project managers. The project managers
had overseen recent projects and provided detailed estimates of the contributions
of different jobs. Nonetheless, the breakdowns are based on a limited sample,
and further research is required to generate more-accurate estimates.

**10.3.2 Results of Occupational Employment Modelling**

There will be an increase in jobs in the 1.5 °C Scenario across all occupations
between 2015 and 2025, except in metal trades, which will display a minor decline
of 2%, as shown in Fig. 10.3.
There will be an increase in jobs across all occupations between 2015 and 2025 in
the 2.0 °C Scenario, as shown in Fig. 10.4. The occupations with the highest number
of jobs will be plant and machine operators and assemblers, followed by technicians
(including electrical, mechanical, civil, and IT technicians) and electricians. The
occupations that will have the largest percentage increase in jobs from 2015 to 2025
will be labourers, engineers, electricians, and construction trades. The results are
similar in the 1.5  °C Scenario, except for managers and metal trades, which will
experience minor reductions in overall jobs (3% each) (Table 10.7).
However, the results are not uniform across regions. For example, China and
India will both experience a reduction in the number of jobs for managers and cleri-
cal and administrative workers between 2015 and 2025, as shown in Table 10.8.
Table 10.8 and Fig. 10.6 show the employment changes between 2015 and 2025

under the 1.5 °C Scenario. Across all eight employment groups, the net effect of the

energy transition will positive or stable (Fig. 10.5).

However, the results are not uniform across regions. For example, China and

India both foresee a reduction in the number of jobs for managers and clerical and

administrative workers between 2015 and 2025, as shown in Table 10.9.

```
Table 10.10 and Fig. 10.5 show the employment changes between 2015 and 2025
```

under the 2.0 °C Scenario. Across all eight employment groups, the net effect of the

energy transition is positive. Further research is required to identify the training

needs for all employment groups.

**10.4 Conclusions**

Under both the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Scenarios, the renewable energy transition is pro-
jected to increase employment. Importantly, this analysis has reviewed the locations
and types of occupations and found that the jobs created in wind and solar PV alone
are enough to replace the jobs lost in the fossil fuel industry across all occupation
types. Further research is required to identify the training needs and supportive poli-
cies needed to ensure a just transition for all employment groups.

**Abstract** This chapter explores the magnitude of the changes in patterns of material
use that will be associated with the increasing deployment of renewable energy and
discusses the implications for sustainable development. In particular, this chapter
focuses on the increased use of lithium and cobalt, metals which are used extensively
in battery technologies, and silver used in solar cells. Consistent with the strong
growth in renewable energy and electrification of the transport system required in a
1.5°C scenario, the material requirements also rise dramatically, particularly for
cobalt and lithium. Scenarios developed for this study show that increasing recycling
rates and material efficiency can significantly reduce primary demand for metals.

**11.1 Introduction**

Globally, recent investments in new renewable energy infrastructure have been dou-

ble the investments in new energy from fossil fuels and nuclear power (REN21

[^2018]:). This is strong evidence of the increasing momentum of the energy transition

away from fossil fuels. A rapid transition to 100% renewables offers hope for reduc-

ing carbon emissions and increasing the chance that global warming will be main-

tained to below 2.0 °C. However, the transition to 100% renewables also comes with

requirements for new patterns of material use to support the renewable energy infra-

structure, including wind turbines, solar cells, batteries, and other technologies.

This chapter explores the magnitude of the changes in patterns of material use

that will be associated with the increasing deployment of renewable energy, and

discusses the implications for sustainable development. In particular, this chapter

focuses on the increased use of lithium (used extensively in battery technology),

cobalt (again used in batteries, particularly for vehicles), and silver (used in solar
cells because it is an excellent conductor of electricity).
The importance of understanding how material use is affected by renewable
energy technologies is already established (Ali et  al. [^2017]:; Valero et  al. [^2018]:). A
range of studies have identified different aspects of the challenges associated with
the supply of the materials needed for renewable energy. The first aspect is the avail-
ability of mineral supplies. For example, Mohr et al. ([^2012]:) developed commodity-
focused supply projections for lithium, with an emphasis on the origins and locations
of available lithium deposits over time, which are contrasted with a simple demand
function. Other studies have placed more emphasis on demand scenarios, either for
a specific geographic location, such as Germany (Viebahn et al. [^2015]:) or globally
(Valero et al. [^2018]:; Watari et al. [^2018]:), and some have explored the role of technol-
ogy mixes and material substitution in detail (Månberger and Stenqvist [^2018]:).
In addition to issues of resource availability, environmental and social issues
have also been explored (Giurco et  al. [^2014]:; Florin and Dominish [^2017]:) and the
need for improved resource governance has been highlighted (Prior et al. [^2013]:; Ali
et al. [^2017]:). This chapter evaluates the total demand to determine which metals may
present bottlenecks to the supply of renewable energy technologies. The potential to
offset primary demand is explored through a range of scenarios for technology type,
material efficiency, and recycling rates. This chapter draws on the results of a larger
study funded by Earthworks (see Dominish et al. 2019).
This chapter has five sections. Following this introductory section, the second
section outlines the material requirements for key renewable energy infrastructure
technologies, namely solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, and batteries. The
key assumptions, and the energy and resource scenarios are described in Sect. 11.3,
together with a summary of the methodology, which is described in detail in Chap.
[^3]:. The requirements for selected materials (lithium, cobalt, and silver) are presented
in Sect. 11.4. Following the results, a discussion is presented in Sect. 11.5.

**11.2 Overview of Metal Requirements for each Technology**

Renewable energy and storage technologies typically have high and diverse metal

requirements. Moreover, there are often competing technologies or component

technologies, which add to the complexity of material considerations. The key met-

als used for solar PV, wind power, batteries, and EV are discussed below.

**11.2.1 Solar PV**

A typical crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV panel, which is currently the dominant tech-

nology, with over 95% of the global market, contains about 76% glass (panel sur-

face), 10% polymer (encapsulant and back-sheet foil), 8% aluminium (frame), 5%

silicon (solar cells), 1% copper (interconnectors), and less than 0.1% silver (contact

lines) and other metals (e.g., tin and lead). Thin film technologies,

```

```

```

copper–indium–gallium–(di)selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe), make
up the remainder of the market. These technologies require less material overall
than crystalline silicon. For CdTe panels, the composition is 96–97% glass, 3%–4%
polymer, and less than 1% semi-conductor materials (CdTe) and other metals (e.g.,
nickel, zinc, tin). CIGS contain about 88%–89% glass, 7% aluminium, 4% polymer,
and less than 1% semi-conductor material (indium, gallium, selenium) and other
metals (e.g., copper) (Weckend et al. [^2016]:). Figure 11.1 provides a simplified dia-
gram of the PV supply chain, including key materials and sub-components.

**11.2.2 Wind**

The major raw materials required for the manufacture of wind turbine components
are bulk commodities: iron ore, copper, aluminium, limestone, and carbon. Wind
turbines use steel for the towers, nacelle structural components, and the drivetrain,
accounting for about 80% of the total weight. Some turbine generator designs use
direct-drive magnetics, which contain the rare earth metals neodymium and dyspro-
sium **(**Fig. 11.2**).** The development of direct-drive permanent magnet generators
(PMG) by major producers (e.g., Siemens and General Electric) simplifies the
design by eliminating the gearbox, and this is attractive for offshore applications
because it reduces maintenance (Zimmermann et al. [^2013]:). It is estimated that about
20% of all installed wind turbines (both onshore and offshore) use rare earth mag-
nets (CEMAC [^2017]:).

**11.2.3 Batteries and Electric Vehicles**

This study focuses on lithium ion batteries (LIBs), which power almost all electric

vehicles (EVs) on the market today and are also an important technology for sta-

tionary energy-storage applications. LIBs are made of two electrodes (anode and

cathode), current collectors, a separator, electrolyte, a container, and sealing parts.

The anode is typically made of graphite, with a copper foil current collector. The

cathode is typically a layered transition metal oxide, with an aluminium foil current

collector. In between the electrodes is a porous separator and electrolyte. All of

these components are typically housed in an aluminium container. LIBs are gener-

ally referred to by the material content of the cathode, which accounts for 90% of

the material value and about 25% of the total weight (Gratz et al. [^2014]:).

```
The size and type of the LIB has the greatest impact on the material require-
```

ments. Since commercialization in the 1990s, a range of different types (‘chemis-

tries’) have been developed for different applications, named according to the metals

in the cathode. The most common LIB types for EV applications are nickel–manga-

nese–cobalt (NMC), lithium–iron phosphate (LFP), nickel–cobalt–aluminium

(NCA), and lithium–manganese oxide (LMO) (Vaalma et  al. [^2018]:). NMC is the

most common battery type for passenger vehicles, and NCA is also common, with

a small share for LMO. However, in China, LFP is the dominant chemistry. Electric

buses have traditionally used LFP batteries (BNEF [^2018]:) and lead–acid batteries are

most commonly used for two-wheel vehicles. However, the application of LIBs in

this market sector is growing (Yan et al. [^2018]:).

For energy storage, NMC and NCA are the most commonly used chemistries. A

simplified overview of the lithium-ion battery supply chain, including its key metals

```

```

```

(for the NMC chemistry) and sub-components, is shown in Fig. 11.3. Rare earth

permanent magnets using neodymium and dysprosium are common in most electric

vehicle motors. Other motor technologies, or those that replace rare earths with

lower-cost materials, are under development and are already used in some vehicles.

However, rare earth magnets are expected to remain the standard for the foreseeable

future because of their higher performance characteristics (Widmer et al. [^2015]:).

**11.3 Scenarios and Key Assumptions**

**11.3.1 Electricity and Transport Scenarios**

The energy scenarios presented here were developed to achieve the climate target in

the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement of limiting anthropogenic climate change to a

maximum of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. This projection is more ambitious

than the IEA’s annual World Energy Outlook (WEO) scenarios, which project that

current policies, and therefore the global development of renewable power and elec-

tric mobility, will not change. In contrast, many scenarios have been proposed in the

**Fig. 11.3** Overview of key metal requirements and supply chain for LIB and EV

[^11]: Requirements for Minerals and Metals for 100% Renewable Scenarios

442

academic literature that extend as far as zero emissions, whereas the IEA’s own

“Energy Technology Perspectives” (ETP) scenarios include both a 2.0 °C scenario

(2DS) and a more ambitious “Beyond 2.0 °C” scenario (B2DS), which aim to achieve

the Paris targets. The scenario proposed here includes both a shift to 100% renewable

electricity and a shift to renewable electricity and fuels in the transport sector.

In this scenario, solar PV will account for more than one-third of the installed

capacity by 2050, with the remainder from wind and other renewables. Lithium-ion

batteries will account for approximately 6% of energy storage (which will be domi-

nated by pumped hydro and hydrogen).

In the transport system, we focus on the material requirements for the batteries

used in road transport, because other types of transport do not require batteries to

power drivetrains or are assumed to rely on other forms of energy (e.g., biofuels for

aviation). In 2050, most of the energy for road transport will come from electricity

(55%) and hydrogen (22%), and the remainder will be from biofuels and synfuels.

In the 1.5 °C Scenario, the batteries required to electrify road transport are specified

for electric buses and passenger cars, including battery electric vehicles (BEV),

plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and commercial vehicles. Passenger cars

will account for 92% of vehicles and 51% of battery capacity, whereas commercial

vehicles are projected to account for 48% of battery capacity, although they will

make up only 8% of the total fleet of vehicles. This is because the battery sizes for

commercial vehicles (assumed to be 250  kWh in 2015 and rising to 600  kWh in

2050) are larger than those for passenger vehicles (5–15 kWh for PHEV and 38–62

kWh for BEV). Buses will account for a small percentage (1%) of both vehicles and

batteries. Electric bikes and scooters have been excluded, because although they are

currently a growing market in Asia, by 2050, their share of electricity consumption

will be negligible compared with the predicted uptake of electric passenger and

commercial vehicles. Lead–acid batteries are also the main type of battery for elec-

tric bikes and scooters, although lithium-ion may replace these in future.

**11.3.2 Resource Scenario Development**

Five resource scenarios were developed to estimate the metal demand for 100%

renewables, as shown in Table 11.1. The scenarios were developed based on the

current market trends and the likelihood of changes in material efficiency or tech-

nology. Our aim is to understand how primary demand can be offset through changes

in technology or recycling rates.

**11.3.3 Technology Assumptions**

The total metal demand for renewable energy and battery technology each year is

estimated based on the metal intensity of a specific technology and the capacity of

each technology introduced in a specific year. This introduced stock will accounts

```
D. Giurco et al.
```

```
443
```

for the new capacity and the replacement of technologies at the end of their lives,
based on a lifetime distribution curve for the average lifetime.
The values for metal intensity are given in tonnes/GW (for solar PV) or tonnes/
GWh (for batteries) of capacity, and two values are given for each metal to evaluate
the impact of improving the material efficiency (for solar PV) and technology shifts
(for batteries). To evaluate the impact of recycling, the primary demand is estimated
by multiplying the discarded products by the recycling rate. The recycling rate is
obtained by multiplying the collection rate by the recovery efficiency of a metal
from a specific technology. This recycling rate is also varied to obtain a current rate
and a potential rate. The potential recycling rate is technologically possible, but is
not currently applicable because it is not economic. The detailed assumptions for
batteries and solar PV are explained in detail in the following section.

**11.3.4 Batteries**

The ‘current materials intensity’ for LIB for EVs and storage (Table 11.2) is esti-
mated based on the assumed market shares of the LIB technologies: NMC (60%),
LMO (20%), NCA (15%), and LFP (5%) (Vaalma et al. [^2018]:). The dominant bat-
tery technologies in the future are not likely to be the same as those commercialized
today. Therefore, for the ‘future technology scenario’, we assume that lithium–sul-
fur batteries will replace LIB for EVs (Cano et al. [^2018]:). We have modelled a future
market (Table 11.3) in which Li–S will achieve a 50% market share for EVs by
2050, with deployment scaling up at a linear rate, assuming the first commercializa-
tion in 2030. In this scenario, the technology does not change for storage batteries.
We have assumed a collection efficiency of 100% for all batteries and a recovery
rate of 90% for Co and Ni (Georgi-Maschler et al. [^2012]:). A 10% recovery rate is
assumed for Li, acknowledging that pyrometallurgical processing routes account
for most of the current global capacity, and Li recovery may not be possible by this

route (King et  al. [^2018]:). For scenarios that assume a ‘potential future recycling’
rate, we have assumed 95% recovery for all metals. This is reasonable given that
100% recovery has been reported in the laboratory (Gratz et al. [^2014]:).[^1] However,
some losses during processing seem unavoidable.[^2]

**11.3.5 Solar PV**

For solar PV, we assume that the technology types do not change until 2050, and
that they retain their current market shares, so that crystalline silicon will remain the
dominant technology. We have modelled the potential to offset demand through
increases in material efficiency and increases in recycling.
A high and a low value are given for silver to show the impact of material effi-
ciency on silver demand. The current data on silver intensity are from a survey of the
PV industry (ITRPV [^2018]:), and the future material efficiency is based on an assumed
minimum amount of silver (Kavlak et  al. [^2015]:). The ‘current recycling rate’ sce-
narios assume a current collection rate of 85% for all panels, consistent with the
target of the EU WEEE Directive.[^3] This should be considered an average rate, not-
ing that remote and/or distributed roof-top systems will be more costly to collect and
transport than large utility-scale PV. We assume that no recycling is currently occur-

ring for silver from PV, but that 95% recovery may be possible. Therefore, for the
‘potential recycling rate’ scenarios, we assume a 95% recovery efficiency and an
85% collection rate, which will result in an 81% metal recycling rate.

**11.3.6 Metal Assumptions**

For each scenario, the annual primary demand is compared with the current produc-
tion (2017 data), and the cumulative demand to 2050 is compared with current
reserves. The data presented (Table 11.4) highlight the annual production, total
resources, and reserves. ‘Reserves’ are the subset of the total resources that can be
economically mined under current conditions. They are dependent on a multitude of
factors and can change over time. By contrast, resources are less certain economi-
cally and there may be no firm plan to mine them. Over time, new resources can be
discovered and as economic conditions change, resources may be upgraded to
reserves (for example, where the price for the metal increases, thus making lower-
grade or more-challenging ores profitable or where a new technology for extraction
allows lower cost processing). In contrast, reserve estimates can also be downgraded
over time (as occurred with coal reserve estimates in UK and Germany).

**11.4 Results for Lithium, Cobalt, and Silver**

The cumulative demand from renewable energy technologies for cobalt, lithium, and
silver by 2050 has been modelled, and is compared to current reserves in Fig. 11.4.
The cumulative demand for cobalt from renewable energy and transport exceeds the
current reserves in all scenarios, and for lithium, the cumulative demand is exceeded
in all scenarios, except the ‘potential recycling scenario’. For silver, the total demand
for silver from renewable energy will reach around 50% of current reserves.
The annual demand in 2050 is compared with the current rates of production
(based on 2017 data). Both cobalt and lithium have annual demands that far exceed
the current rates of production—particularly lithium in the ‘future technology’ sce-
nario. However, the annual demand for silver will remain below current production
levels (Fig. 11.5).
The detailed results for each metal are shown in the following section.

**Table 11.4** Metal assumptions

Cobalt 110,000 7,100,000 25,000,000

Silver 25,000 530,000 N/A

**11.4.1 Cobalt**

The annual demand for cobalt from EVs and storage could exceed the current pro-

duction rates in around 2023 (in all scenarios). In the ‘future technology’ scenario,

shifting to Li–S instead of LIB will reduce the demand for cobalt. However, recy-

cling, rather than shifting technologies, will have the greatest impact on reducing

the primary demand in both the current technology and future technology

scenarios.

The cumulative total demand to 2050 (with current technology and no recycling)

could exceed current reserves by 400%, and exceed current resources by 20%. Even

with recycling and a shift to technologies that use less cobalt, the cumulative demand

will still exceed reserves. However, in these scenarios, the demand will remain

below the resource levels (Figs. 11.6 and 11.7).

**11.4.2 Lithium**

The annual demand for lithium for EVs and storage could exceed the current pro-
duction rates by around 2022 (in all scenarios). In the ‘future technology and no
recycling’ scenario, a shift to Li–S will increase the demand for lithium, because
these batteries have a higher amount of lithium. Increasing recycling from its cur-
rent low levels (which are assumed to be 10%) will offer the greatest potential to
offset the primary demand for lithium.
The cumulative demand for lithium by 2050 will be below the resource levels for
all scenarios, but will exceed the reserves unless there is a shift to a high recycling
rate. The cumulative demand could be as high as 170% of the current reserves with
the current technology, and could be 280% of current reserves with a switch to Li–S
batteries (Figs. 11.8 and 11.9).

**11.4.3 Silver**

The total annual demand for silver could reach more than 40% of the current pro-
duction rates by 2050, assuming no recycling and that the materials efficiency does
not change (Fig. 11.10). The cumulative demand to 2050 could reach around half
the current reserves with the current technology, and around one-quarter if the tech-
nology improves (Fig. 11.11). The reduction in material intensity in the ‘future tech-
nology’ scenario, in which silver use decreases from 20 to 4 tonnes/GW, has the
greatest potential to reduce demand.

**11.5 Discussion**

Within the context of the increasing metal resource requirements for the renewable
energy and storage technologies, the rapid increase in the demand for both cobalt
and lithium is of greatest concern, and the demand for both metals will exceed the
current production rates by 2023 and 2022, respectively. The demand for these met-
als will increase more rapidly than it does for silver, partly because solar PV is a
more established technology and silver use has become very efficient, whereas the
electrification of the transport system and the rapid expansion of lithium battery
usage has only begun to accelerate in the last few years.
The potential to offset the primary demand differs, depending on the technology.
Offsetting demand through secondary sources of cobalt and lithium has the most
potential to reduce total primary demand for these metals, as batteries have a com-
paratively short lifetime of approximately 10 years. The cumulative demand for both
metals will exceed current reserves, but with high recycling rates, they can remain
below resource levels. However, there is a delay until the period in which recycling
will offset demand, because there must be enough batteries in use and reaching the
ends of their lives to be collected and recycled. This delay could be further extended
by strategies for the reuse of vehicular batteries as stationary storage, which might
save costs in the short term and increase the uptake of PV. The efficiency of cobalt
use in batteries also significantly reduces demand, and this is already happening as
manufacturers shift towards lower-cobalt chemistries (Energy Insights by McKinsey
[^2018]:). However, this is also likely to lead to an increase in the demand for lithium.
Increasing the efficiency of material use has the biggest potential utility in offset-
ting the demand for PV metals, whereas recycling will have a smaller impact on

demand. This is attributable to the long life-span of solar PV panels, and their lower

potential for recycling. Although not as extreme as the growth of cobalt and lithium,

the growth of silver and its demand in 2050 are still considerable. This is important,

especially when considering that solar PV currently consumes approximately 9% of

end-use silver (The Silver Institute & Thomson Reuters [^2018]:), and although it is

possible to create silver-less solar panels, these panels are not expected to be on the

market in the near future (ITRPV 2018).

**11.5.1 Limitations**

This study only focuses on the metal demand for renewable energy and transport. It

does not take into account other demands for these metals. It is expected that with

the increase in renewable energy, renewable energy technologies will consume a

greater share of these metals. In our modelling, the recycled content used in tech-

nologies comes only from metals from the same technologies at the end of their

lives. However, the demand could potentially be offset by accessing other secondary

sources of the metal. At the same time, these technologies are only one end-use

within the overall economic demand for these metals. The expansion of renewable

energy and storage technologies could have a significant effect on the overall market

dynamics, including influencing prices, which may feed back to the efforts to reduce

material intensity. These results only focus on cobalt, lithium, and silver because of

their importance. However, further analysis is required of other metals that will be

important in the renewable energy transition.

Another important limitation is that this analysis does not consider the impact of

the demand for a mineral on the mining of that mineral and therefore on the amount

of energy required for this mining and processing activity. In particular, as the

potential ore grade declines, and polymetallic ore processing and the mining of

deeper ore bodies increase, it is possible that this feedback loop could have a more-

than-marginal influence on the overall sectoral energy consumption. To examine

this is an area accurately will require much more-complex modelling.

**11.5.2 Comparison with Other Studies**

A large number of studies have examined scenarios for renewable energy and stor-

age technologies that will mitigate climate change. In recent years, there has also

been an upsurge in studies of mineral ‘criticality’, which have paralleled the present

study in terms of the high penetration of renewable and storage technologies and the

potential constraints that certain minerals may impose. This increased interest has

been prompted to some extent by China’s rare earth export restrictions of

2009–2011, which reflect the sense that mineral supply chains are still quite inse-
cure. Most of these studies have addressed specific technologies or specific coun-
tries or regions, rather than global climate targets. A number of studies have
specifically and directly addressed the Paris Agreement targets (ensuring that the
temperature rise does not exceed 2.0 °C), although the modelling frameworks have
been slightly different. Some of the authors of the present chapter have been
involved in these studies (Tokimatsu et al. [^2017]:; Watari et al. [^2018]:).
A range of variables affect the results, including the installed capacity and tech-
nology type in the energy scenario; the assumed market demand of technology
types (e.g., type of battery or solar panel); and the material intensity assumptions.
The projected future demand for lithium is higher than in previous studies, and that
for cobalt is similar or higher (Månberger and Stenqvist [^2018]:; Watari et al. [^2018]:;
Valero et  al. [^2018]:; Watari et  al. [^2018]:), as shown in Table 11.5. This is primarily
attributable to the ambitious renewable energy scenario used in this study, which
includes achieving a 100% renewable transport system by 2050, whereas the other
studies have still included a large share of gasoline-powered cars in 2050. This
study also includes batteries for stationary energy storage, whereas the other studies
have only included batteries for road transport. Moreover, this study assumes a
shorter battery life of 10 years, based on current warranties, whereas some scenarios
assume a longer life.
The results for silver are in the middle of the range of results given by other stud-
ies. Our scenario includes a higher installed capacity of PV in 2050 than the other
studies. However, this study also assumes a lower metal intensity than previous
studies, because new data have been published based on the current material use by
the PV industry (ITRPV [^2018]:).

**11.6 Supply Impacts and Challenges**

In addition to the material requirements for renewable technologies explored earlier

in this chapter, it is important to understand the changes in the available supply, the

geopolitical landscape, and the associated social and environmental impacts, which

are outlined below.

**11.6.1 Geopolitical Landscape**

The geopolitical shift underway in the supply of the resources required for the
globe’s future energy mix is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11.12. Whereas the value of
the lithium industry is much less than the value of the oil industry, this comparison
highlights a distinct shift in the energy commodities that society values. Oil’s rate of
use is projected to decline somewhat in the decade ahead (Mohr et al. [^2015]:), whereas
lithium’s production is expected to grow rapidly (Mohr et al. [^2012]:).
Although it is not a key focus of this particular chapter, the dominance of China
in the supply of rare earths has encouraged manufacturing countries to look at diver-
sifying their supply sources, including through the recovery of rare earths from
recycled material. A similar situation of heavily concentrated supply occurs for
cobalt, where the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the largest supplier, at
around 66,000 tonnes per year. The next four largest cobalt-producing countries
(China, Canada, Russia, and Australia) only produce 5–7000 tonnes per year each.
The supply chain is also concentrated downstream, with around 50% of cobalt
smelted and refined in China.

**11.6.2 Social and Environmental Impacts**

The mining and supply chain for these metals can have adverse social and environ-
mental consequences for workers, local communities, and the environment. These
impacts are most significant for the cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, where there are human rights violations, child labour, and severe environ-
mental pollution affecting health (Florin and Dominish [^2017]:).
These types of impacts at mine sites and along the supply chain also influence the
availability of primary resources. For example, whereas Australia and Chile are
large producers of lithium, large deposits remain undeveloped in Bolivia, due in part
to local concerns over the social and environmental impacts. The global silver mar-
ket receives less media attention than the market for lithium, but the world’s second-
largest silver mine (Escobal) in Guatemala is currently closed by a constitutional

court ruling that the Xinca Indigenous peoples were not adequately consulted before

a mine licence was granted (Jamasmie [^2018]:).

The increased use of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and silver has economic

implications for the future of battery manufacture. For example, the cost of cobalt

has risen dramatically from US$20000/t in 2016 to US$80000 in 2018 (Tchetvertakov

[^2018]:). This is prompting manufacturers to look for alternatives, such as nickel,

vanadium, and zinc (Tchetvertakov [^2018]:). At the same time, a significant propor-

tion of these price fluctuations are attributable to non-industrial factors, such as

investment and speculation in metal markets, which may also require greater regula-

tion to avoid unnecessary restrictions on renewable energy and storage

technologies.

**11.6.2.1 Recycling Challenges**

Whilst recycling can help to offset primary material demand through recycled

sources, there are technological, social and environmental challenges to increasing

recycling. The collection systems and infrastructure required to recycle metals from

renewable energy technologies are not well established. For example, although sil-

ver has an overall recycling rate of 30–50% (Graedel et al. [^2011]:), almost no recy-

cling of silver from PV panels occurs, because most recycling of PV panels focuses

on recycling the glass, aluminium, and copper. Most of the processes used to recycle

lithium-ion batteries focus on the recovery of cobalt and nickel, because of their

higher price, so that lithium is downcycled into less valuable products, such as

cement. It should also be noted that the recycling of some key energy materials,

such as rare earths in magnets, does not offer significant cost savings or environ-

mental benefits over their extraction from primary resources (McLellan et al. [^2013]:).

The establishment of effective collection networks is important for recycling.

Collection networks must be easily understood and must provide easily accessible

deposit mechanisms. Recycling can be both informal and formal, and whereas in

some cases, informal collection networks offer greater rates of recycling, the social

and environmental impacts can be higher. For example, recycling electronic waste

on open fires creates hazardous fumes for informal recyclers and has detrimental

effects on the environment. There is also a potential tension between reducing mate-

rial intensity and the ability to effectively separate, recover, and recycle materials.

Increasingly, thin layers of material are being utilized because of improved manu-

facturing processes, which can reduce the costs of products in their first lifetimes.

However, as the material content decreases, the value of the secondary production

decreases, making it a less attractive option for investment. Again, the use of

advanced, complex materials can sometimes make valuable materials difficult to

separate from each other, and this again increases the costs and reduces the profits

for investors in recovery processes.

```
To ensure that social and environmental issues will be addressed, several initia-
```

tives across supply chains are being developed, including the China-led Responsible

Cobalt Initiative, the Cobalt Institute, the Initiative for Responsible Mining

Assurance, Solving the Ewaste Problem (StEP), and the R2 standard for sustainable

electronics recycling. In the USA, the Dodd-Frank Act has mandated the traceabil-

ity of the gold, tin, tungsten, and tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This has arisen from the international concern over the social impacts and implica-

tions of sourcing metals from that country, and in particular, to avoid supporting

conflict and environmental damage. However, cobalt is not explicitly mentioned in

the Dodd-Frank Act.

International resource governance that looks beyond renewable energy and

beyond a single commodity focus is increasingly recognised as a missing area in

environmental policy (Ali et al. [^2017]:). The transition to renewable energy and the

associated requirements for resources to support this transition could be a catalyst

for advancing such policies.

**11.7 Concluding Remarks**

This chapter has given an overview of the material requirements for key renewable

energy technologies and the projected demands for lithium, cobalt, and silver.

Consistent with the strong growth in renewable energy and the electrification of the

transport system required by the 1.5 °C scenario, these material requirements will

also increase dramatically, particularly those for cobalt and lithium. The high total

demand requirements for these metals emphasize the importance of recycling, alter-

native chemistries, and transport planning and practices (including city design to

encourage active and public transport, as well as car sharing and pooling). The key

messages of this chapter are: it is important to design for both renewable energy and

resource cycles; and it is important to adopt a systems view that considers the avail-

able supply and also social and environmental factors. To support sustainable devel-

opment goals, both the primary and secondary sources of the resources required to

underpin the renewable energy transformation must be stewarded effectively as the

supply chains develop.

#### Implications of the Developed Scenarios

#### for Climate Change

**Malte Meinshausen**

**Abstract** This section provides a summary of the implications of the developed
2.0 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios for global mean climate change. Specifically, we con-
sider atmospheric CO[^2]: concentrations, radiative forcing, global-mean surface air
temperatures and sea level rise.

The question addressed in this section is what the implications are for future climate
change if the world were to follow the energy-related CO[^2]: emissions developed here,
complemented by land-use CO[^2]: emissions and those of other greenhouses gases
(GHGs). According to the high-emission scenario with unabated fossil fuel use, the
world could experience 1400 ppm CO[^2]: concentrations by the end of 2100, which is
five times higher than the pre-industrial background concentration of 278 ppm. Our
ice-core records have shown that over the last 850,000 years, the CO[^2]: concentrations
have only oscillated between approximately 180 ppm and 280 ppm. In fact, for the
last 10  million years on this planet, the CO[^2]: concentrations have probably not

exceeded the CO[^2]: concentrations that our thirst for fossil fuels would propel the
world into in just two centuries.

That is a dramatic change to the thin layer of atmosphere that wraps our planet.
Even if any climate change consequences that follow from this dramatic change in
CO[^2]: concentrations are disregarded, the consequences will be dramatic. At atmo-
spheric CO[^2]: concentrations above 900 ppm, the acidity level in the oceans will drop
below the so-called ‘aragonite saturation level’, which is the level required for coral
reefs and other organisms with calciferous shells to sustain their structures (Ricke
et al. [^2013]:). Therefore, without even considering ocean warming and the associated
bleaching, this would mean the end of much marine life as we know it.

The international community uses various scenarios to explore these future changes
to CO[^2]:, involving other GHGs and ultimately, temperature, precipitation changes,
and changes involving extreme events. Here, we compare the scenarios developed
in this study with the standard scenarios developed for the forthcoming
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. The
scenarios used in the forthcoming IPCC Sixth Assessment Report are the so-called
‘SSP scenarios’. The full range of those nine SSP scenarios spans cases of unabated
fossil fuel use at the higher-emissions end to two scenarios at the lower-emission
end that are considered to be consistent with a 2  °C and 1.5  °C warming target.
These two scenarios are called ‘SSP1_26’ and ‘SSP1_19’, respectively.
Both of those lower-emissions scenarios imply a substantial amount of biomass
use for energy, combined with CCS, to draw down atmospheric CO[^2]: levels. This is
the key difference from the scenarios developed in the present study. Whereas we
use a substantial amount of negative CO[^2]: emissions in the reforestation and forest
restoration options, our analysis does not depend on the assumption that biomass,
combined with CCS, must be used on large scale to achieve either the 2 °C or 1.5 °C
target.
If we do not rely on some negative CO[^2]: emission options, in particular biomass
and CCS, the questions are: (1) to what extent are those negative emissions created
by other means (e.g., reforestation); or (2) whether CO[^2]: emissions can be reduced
in the first place so that we do not need to rely on negative emissions options; or (3)

whether other non-CO[^2]: gases can be reduced even further to make negative CO2
emissions unnecessary. The scenarios developed in this study use all three options,

as outlined in the previous chapters. Not only will energy-related CO[^2]: emissions be
radically reduced, CO[^2]: uptake via reforestation and forest restoration will also play
an important role. This study takes a more conservative approach to non-CO[^2]: gases
by being consistent with other stringent mitigation scenarios. Thereby, we ensure
that the feasibility constraints implicitly or explicitly set by other modelling frame-
works are not violated.

**12.2 Comparison of Atmospheric CO**[^2]: **Concentrations**
**and Radiative Forcing**

As mentioned above, unabated fossil fuel use over the last century and the twenty-
first century will dramatically change the oceans, simply by creating an atmospheric
CO[^2]: concentration beyond that present on the Earth for the last 10 million years.
Currently, we just exceeded the historical maximum level of 400 ppm atmospheric
CO[^2]: and are continuing to add 2–3 ppm a year. If we consider the most stringent
mitigation scenario used in the preparation of the forthcoming IPCC Sixth
Assessment Report, SSP1_19, then we will reach 400 ppm concentrations again in
the latter half of the century. Staying below 400 ppm is a prerequisite in the long
term for remaining below 2 °C or reaching 1.5 °C warming.

Figure 12.1 shows the global CO[^2]:, CH[^4]:, and N[^2]:O concentrations under the key
RCP and SSP scenarios and the three scenarios developed as part of this study. Our
1.5 °C scenario is clearly lower in terms of its CO[^2]: concentrations than the lowest
SSP scenario, SSP1_19, for practically the entire twenty-first century (upper panel).
Only towards the end of the twenty-first century do the strongly negative CO[^2]: emis-
sions in the SSP1_19 scenario bring the CO[^2]: concentration closer towards our
1.5 °C scenario.
Aggregating all the greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions by their radiative forc-
ing, and expressing the resulting radiative forcing again as if it were only caused by
CO[^2]: yields the so-called ‘CO[^2]: equivalence concentrations’. In Fig. 12.2, the CO2
equivalence concentrations for the four RCP scenarios, the nine SSP scenarios, and
three scenarios developed in this study are shown. The reference scenario in this
study is quite similar to both the RCP6.0 and SSP4_60 scenarios, providing a
medium-high reference case. The radiative forcing and CO[^2]: equivalence concentra-
tion of the 2 °C scenario of this study is actually quite closely aligned with the lower

SSP1_19 scenario, at least initially until the middle of the second half of this cen-

tury. Thereafter, the net negative CO[^2]: emissions implied by the SSP1_19 scenario
lead to stronger reductions in radiative forcing than the 2.0 °C scenario of our study.

However, our lower 1.5 °C scenario first undercuts the radiative forcing trajectory
of the SSP1_19 scenario, but then ends up at a similar radiative forcing level by

2100.
Figure 12.2 shows CO[^2]: equivalence concentrations (upper panel) and radiative
forcing (lower panel) of the main scenarios used in IPCC Assessment Reports and
this study’s scenarios. The RCP scenarios (shown in thin dotted lines) underlie the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and the so-called ‘SSP scenarios’ provide the main
basis for the scenarios considered in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. The three
scenarios developed in this study are shown in thick blue lines.

**12.3 Comparison of Cumulative CO**[^2]: **Emissions**

Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, cumulative CO[^2]: emissions have been
introduced as a key metric into the international climate debate. Every tonne of
additional CO[^2]: emitted will add to that cumulative burden and warm the planet for
the next hundreds and in fact thousands of years. The only way to halt further global
warming is to halt cumulative CO[^2]: emissions, which means bringing the annual CO2
emissions to basically zero levels. Only with net negative emissions can the tem-
perature thermostat of the Earth be dialled back again. Therefore, while achieving
such net negative emissions is tremendously challenging, it is the only way to main-
tain long-term climate change at levels close to those of today or well below
1.5 °C. Few scenarios include very strong near-term reductions and no substantially
negative CO[^2]: emissions and can limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C, with no or
only a slight overshoot (IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C). In this study, as well as
very strong near-term reductions in energy-related CO[^2]: emissions, we have used a
range of land-use-based sequestration options. These are not unambitious, as

outlined in previous chapters. In fact, in the case of the 1.5 °C scenario, they practi-
cally require that the Earth’s forests be returned to their pre-industrial coverage—a
substantial challenge given the widespread deforestation that has occurred over the
last 100  years. By the end of the century, the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions beyond
levels will constitute around 300 GtCO[^2]: (see Fig. 12.3).
Without going into too much detail about why cumulative emission numbers dif-
fer between various studies, the key point is that CO[^2]: emissions must be reduced to
zero. Otherwise, cumulative emissions and global warming will continue to increase.

Therefore, there is no way to avoid emissions-free electricity, transport, and indus-

trial systems, that either learn to completely get rid themselves of fossil fuels or to

compensates for any remaining use, either by CCS or land-based sequestration.

Because the latter negative emissions option must be used to offset some remaining

agricultural emissions, the story becomes simpler. There is no way around the fast

and complete cessation of all fossil fuel use. This is the simple and powerful logic

of carbon budgets.

Global cumulative CO[^2]: emissions for the scenarios developed in this study (thick
blue lines) and other literature-reported scenarios from the RCP and SSP sets. It is
clear that this study’s 2.0 °C pathway initially reaches a similar cumulative emis-
sions level as the SSP1_19 scenario, before the cumulative CO[^2]: emissions are
reduced again in SSP1_19 with large-scale net negative CO[^2]: emissions via bioen-
ergy with carbon capture and storage. In contrast, the reduction of cumulative CO2
emissions in this study’s 1.5 °C scenarios starts to plateau much earlier (by 2035)
and are then reduced by land -based sequestration options, such as reforestation and
forest restoration (thick blue line at the lower end). The stated blue 1.5 °C carbon

**12.4 Implications for Temperature and Sea-Level Rise**

This section examines the implications of the three scenarios developed in this
study for the probabilistic global mean temperature and sea level rise. Based on the
latest version 7 of the reduced complexity carbon cycle and climate model MAGICC,
we can derive a range of projections for every scenarios that provides a good mea-
sure of the projection uncertainties over the twenty-first century. We ran this model
600 times for each scenario, varying wide ranges of feedback and forcing parame-
ters. For the sea-level rise projections, we used the new sea-level rise module of
MAGICC7, as described by Nauels et al. ([^2017]:) and drove that with our probabilis-
tic temperature projections. We did not include the recent finding that possible
Antarctic ice sheet instability could lead to a much greater sea-level rise this cen-
tury. These extra contributions to sea-level rise are also assumed to affect the higher
end of the projections for high-emission scenarios, and do not therefore change the
sea-level rise projections of the lower-emissions scenarios.
A key question regarding future temperature projections is whether the scenarios
will stay below the envisaged 1.5  °C and 2.0  °C warming levels relative to pre-
industrial levels. When answering this question in terms of the consistency of the
1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming levels, the uncertainty in historical reconstructions of
temperatures must play a role. The latest IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C warming
estimated from an average of four studies that the difference between early-industrial
(1850–1900) and recent surface air temperature levels (2006–2015) was 0.97 °C. If
we accept here the slightly oversimplified assumption that the 1850–1900 tempera-
ture levels can be equated with pre-industrial temperatures, we can evaluate the
difference towards a 1.5 °C warming level, namely 0.53 °C. Note that this distance
could be shorter—a matter of ongoing scientific debate.
Anyway, the median temperatures for the (lowest) 1.5 °C Scenario in this study
do indeed—somewhat by design—reach the 1.5 °C target level by 2100. This means
that after a slight overshoot, there will be a 50% chance by 2100 that the global
mean temperature is at or below 1.5  °C warming—and without the widespread
deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

[^1]:The IPCC Special Report estimates for a 0.53 °C distance of the 1.5 °C degree target from the
2006–2015 level, a carbon budget of 560 GtCO[^2]: from 1 January 2018 onwards. Reduced by 100
GtCO[^2]:for additional Earth System Feedbacks (see Table 2.2in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C)
and adding approximately 270 GtCO[^2]: emissions for the period from 2011 to 2017, the central
estimate for a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 °C warming as stated by IPCC is approximately

730 GtCO[^2]: from 2011 onwards. This is for a definition of historical warming that is based on a
consistent surface air temperature estimate over the land and oceans. A further reduction of
approximately 150 GtCO[^2]: would result, if we take into account that the IPCC carbon budget esti-
mate refer to a 1850–1900 early industrial reference period for the 1.5 °C warming, rather than a
1750 pre-industrial reference period (which makes approximately a 0.1 °C difference, with +− 0.1
°C uncertainty).

[^12]: Implications of the Developed Scenarios for Climate Change

466

In the case of our 2 °C Scenario, the centric 66% range is almost entirely below
the 2 °C warming level, which means that the chance of maintaining temperature
change below 2 °C is 80%–85%, in the modelling framework used. This warming
level and likelihood fits well with the adapted Paris Agreement target, which shifted
from a ‘below 2 °C’ to a ‘well below 2°C’ formulation.
Of course, there are several uncertainties that are not addressed in those probabi-
listic temperature projections. Therefore, future investigations might shift the
estimates for a 50%, lower, or higher chance of staying below 1.5 °C warming level
relative to the pre-industrial level.
Figure 12.4 shows the global mean surface air temperature projections, and their
66% and 90% ranges, for the three scenarios developed in this study. The reference
scenario is shown in red, the 2.0 °C pathway is shown in blue, and the 1.5 °C path-
way is shown in green. For historical temperatures, a mixture between ocean-surface
and land-surface air temperatures is shown, namely the HadCRUT4 dataset. The
most recent estimate by the IPCC of the pre-industrial air surface temperature levels
is that they were around 0.97 °C below the 2006–2015 levels. The median projec-
tions of the three scenarios are shown in thick solid lines.
As a first approximation, the global mean temperature is proportional to the sum
of all historical CO[^2]: emissions. In a similar vein, sea-level rise is the sum over all
past temperature rises relative to the pre-industrial level. Combining these two

approximations yields the rule of thumb that sea-level rise is proportional to the

double integral of CO[^2]: emissions. Therefore, whereas temperatures are relatively

agnostic about when CO[^2]: emissions occurred, sea-level rise will be higher the lon-
ger ago the CO[^2]: emission occurred.
This proportionality has implications for our scenarios. As we saw previously,
our scenarios are relatively low in terms of radiative forcing early in the twenty-first
century compared with the lower scenarios of the SSP and RCP sets. Towards the
end of this century, the strongly net negative emissions of the SSP1_19 scenario will
cause radiative forcing (and approximate temperature) to be similar under SSP1_19
and our 1.5 °C scenario. That our scenarios will first entail lower and then similar
forcing and temperature levels suggests that the implied sea-level rise will be lower
for the second half of the twenty-first century and beyond, even though the 2100
temperature level might be similar. This is a clear benefit of our scenarios and should
be investigated further in the future.
Thus, there is clearly an advantage in undertaking concerted early action rather a
slower decline in emissions followed by strong negative emissions. This is impor-
tant. However, in the larger scheme of things, it is clearly a second-order effect.
Even under the strongest mitigation scenarios, we cannot expect sea-level rise to
stop any time soon. To halt sea-level rise in the 21st or even the twenty-second cen-
tury, we will require massively negative CO[^2]: emissions, drawing back out of the
atmosphere a lot of the CO[^2]: that we emitted this century. Therefore, even under our
low 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C scenarios, the expected sea-level rise by 2100 will be above
30 cm relative to the 2010 levels—and will continue to rise to 2100 (Fig. 12.5).

The Paris Agreement central aim is to strengthen the global
response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global
temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-
industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase even further to 1.5 °C.

The Paris Agreement’s goals require significant change in how we use and produce
energy on a global level. This energy transition must be started immediately and
without further delay, and concerns energy-producing industry and utilities as well
as every energy consumer—from the industry level down to the residential sector. A
combination of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies will involve
new business concepts for the energy sector, which will require entirely new poli-
cies that provide a new market framework. The implementation of new technologies
and business concepts will include policy changes on the community level as well
as by national governments and international organizations. While the 2.0  °C
Scenario allows for a 3–5 years transition period in which to implement policy mea-
sures, the 1.5 °C Scenario allows no further delay but requires an immediate start,
at the latest in 2020. Therefore, the 1.5 °C Scenario presented in this book provides
a technical pathway that assumes and allows no political delay, and may therefore
be seen as a technical benchmark scenario.
However, this energy transition cannot be seen in isolation. To stay within the
Paris Agreement Goal requires reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission that
are greater than can be delivered by the energy transition alone (see Chap. [^4]:).
However, there are technical and logistical limits to how fast new technologies can
be implemented. The establishment of efficient transport systems and industry pro-
cesses, or simply the provision of required renewable energy and storage technolo-
gies will require a minimum time. Production capacities must increase significantly,
people must be trained, and existing buildings must be retro-fitted. Infrastructural
changes, such as smart power grids, must be planed, construction permits must be
issued. The energy transition will require political determination and public accep-
tance. Therefore, the planning process will require resolute stakeholder involve-
ment. Furthermore, a fundamental shift in today’s resource-intensive lifestyles
seems unavoidable if we are to limit global warming. In particular, the way con-
sumption and mobility are organized in developed countries today will challenge
planetary boundaries to the extreme if they remain at their current levels.
During the development of the energy scenario pathways, it became clear that
even the most ambitious ‘man-on-the-moon’ program—if focussed only on the
energy sector—would not be enough. Therefore, the political framework required to
implement the Paris Agreement on national levels must also take the land-use sec-
tor, as well as the main GHGs, methane, N[^2]:O, and fluorinated gases, into account.
The following sections present the main findings and lessons of this research proj-

ect, and highlight its limitations and further research requirements. Finally, we pro-

vide policy recommendations for the energy sector in order to implement the -energy

scenarios.

**13.1 Findings and Limitations—Modelling**

The following section focuses on the main findings in all parts of the research, with
priority given to high-level lessons, to avoid the repetition of previous chapters.

**13.1.1 Key Findings—Renewable Energy Potential Mapping**

Various research projects have analysed renewable energy potentials and all have in

common that the renewable energy potential exceeded the current and projected

energy demands over the next decades by an order of magnitude. However, regional

distributions are uneven, and especially in densely populated regions, such as urban

areas, the local renewable energy resource might be unable to supply the demand.

Therefore, renewable energies might have to be transported by power lines or in the

form of gasified or liquid renewable fuels to the demand centre. However, all 10

regions and 75 sub-regions examined had sufficient renewable energy resources to

meet the regional needs.

**13.1.2 Limitations and Further Research—Renewable Energy**

**Potential**

The quality of data varies significantly across the regions and especially detailed

high-resolution surveys have their limits. Due to the limited available data, detailed

mapping of the Eurasia region—especially for Russia and parts of central Asian

countries—was not possible. Therefore, in this case, we relied on research published

in the scientific literature. Onshore wind data were generally only available for 80 m

above the ground, whereas no data for 100–120  m were available in most cases.

However, modern wind turbines operate at those higher levels and wind resources

are generally better at these elevations. Therefore, further research is required using

open source data for onshore and offshore wind data at the 100 m level.

**13.1.3 Key Findings—Transport Scenario**

Transport modelling has shown that the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C pathways can be met

when strong and determined measures are taken, starting immediately. They include

rapid electrification across passenger and freight transport modes, a shift towards

more energy-efficient transport modes, and a build-up of biomass and synfuel

capacities for the transport modes that are less inclined towards electrification due

to range or constructional constraints, as is the case in aviation. In the road sub-

sector, which is the most relevant emission source in the transport area, battery

electric and fuel-cell electric vehicles must be widely introduced, which will also

require a stringent parallel build-up of recharging and refuelling infrastructures.

ertrain shifts and overall efficiency enhancements, fundamental changes in today’s

mobility patterns will also be required to meet the 2.0 °C Scenario, and even more

so for the 1.5 °C pathway. This will apply particularly to the car use habits in the

OECD countries. In essence, definite limitations on transport activities and modal

shifts towards mainly buses and railways in some world regions and sub-sectors will

be required to meet the Paris goals. However, the Non-OECD world regions will

mainly increase their overall transport activity until 2050. The 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C

transport scenario pathways will not be achieved automatically, but will require

long-sighted infrastructural and transport policy framework settings on both inter-

and intra-governmental levels.

**13.1.4 Limitations and Further Research**

**Requirement—Transport**

The statistical databases for several world regions on transport activities and fleet

and powertrain shares are limited, and in those cases, projections, conclusions by

analogy, and estimations were required in our modelling. Therefore, further studies

should focus on enhancing these databases and specify the modelling in more detail,

which could also include case studies of countries instead of regions, to better

address spatial particularities in the transport models. Detailed investigations of

mode shift potentials, based on infrastructure capacity constraints, were considered

to some extent, but deserve more in-depth modelling in future works. Further

research is required to refine the coupling of renewable energy potentials, transport

infrastructure upgrades, and the expansion of on-board energy storage usage.

**13.1.5 Key Findings—Long-Term Energy Scenario**

The 2.0 °C and the 1.5 °C scenarios both represent ambitious pathways that require

fundamental changes in current energy consumption and supply. The key strategies

of these pathways are the implementation of renewable energy technologies and

efficiency improvements in all sectors. The electrification of the transport and heat-

ing sectors and the diversification of supply technologies are core elements of both

alternative scenarios. Besides numerous technical and structural improvements,

behavioural changes among end-users and major changes in investment activities

and strategies must be achieved. This applies, for example, to the per capita electric-

ity consumption (electric appliances without heating) of ‘residential and other sec-

tors’, which will decrease in OECD countries by one third between 2015 and

2050 in the 1.5 °C Scenario, but will grows in the non-OECD regions by only 70%

in the same period. This could imply limitations on personal consumption compared

with today’s standards, particularly in OECD countries—at least for as long as fos-

sil fuels still play a significant role. Another example is the final energy demand per

$GDP in the ‘Industry’ sector, which will decrease by 65% in OECD regions and by

80% in non-OECD regions, an ambitious pathway that will require stringent

technology change and replacement strategies and supporting regulatory and gover-

nance measures to trigger huge investments for its realization.

On the energy supply side, considerable contributions in the future are assumed

from wind and solar power, electrification and synthetic fuel use in transport and

heating, sustainable biomass use, especially for co-generation and biofuels, and dis-

trict heating systems that integrate solar, geothermal, and ambient heat potentials.

The exploitation of renewable energy potentials depends strongly on regional con-

ditions. In regions such as India and China, a 100% renewable electricity supply

will require the extensive use of existing potentials. The global installed capacities

of renewable power generation technologies will increase by a factor of more than

12, from 2000 GW in 2015 to more than 25,000 GW in 2050. Cumulative invest-

ments for power generation are estimated to increase between 2015 and 2050 by up

to around US$ 50,000 billion compared with around US$20000 billion in the refer-

ence case. Fuel cost savings could offset around 90% of the additional investment

costs as consequence of the fossil fuel phase-out and reductions in demand, but

without considering the additional infrastructure demands of the transition arising

from grid expansion, storage, and other flexibility demands. In the scenarios, large-

scale and long-range electricity transport between Europe and the MENA countries

is assumed to be a possible and promising example of supra-regional exchange

between regions of production and regions of demand. Many of these import/export

relationships must also be realized among countries _within_ individual world regions

(which are thus not resolved in our model) to increase the security and cost-

efficiency of the energy supply. Decentralization and digitalization, but also the

efficient implementation of new respectively the expansion of existing central infra-

structures, are other implicit core elements of the scenario narratives. The large-

scale generation and use of synthetic fuels are expected to play key roles in the

deep-decarbonisation scenario, at least if the intensity of today’s freight transport

and air traffic is to be maintained, despite the huge energy losses this option will

have. Both alternative scenarios, especially the 1.5  °C Scenario, require a rapid

reduction in the final energy demand and, as far as possible, stagnation in the strong

global growth in the demand for energy services, at least for as long as fossil ener-

gies dominate the energy supply structures.

Besides the structural similarities between both the 2.0 °C and 1.5 °C Scenarios,

one main difference between them is the rate of transformation: To maintain the

average global temperature increase due to climate change below 1.5 °C, the trans-

formation must be accomplished as fast as technically possible. The trend in increas-

ing global energy-related CO[^2]: emissions must be reversed as soon as possible (in
the early 2020s, at the latest) and emissions must be reduced by 70% in 2035 and by

85% in 2040 (compared with emission levels in 1990). Every single year without
significant emission reductions on the global level will dramatically reduce our
chance to confine global warming to 1.5  °C.  In contrast, in the 2.0  °C Scenario,
emission reductions in 2035 may be in the order of 40% and 65% in 2040, leaving
a little more time for the transition process.

**13.1.6 Limitations and Further Research Requirement—**

**Long-Term Energy Scenario**

The 1.5  °C Scenario may seem more difficult than similarly ambitious scenarios

that were made 10 to even 20 years ago. However, the opportunities to respond to

climate change have been largely wasted in the last two decades, and all transition

processes have faced huge obstacles in the past due to the inertia and conflicting

aims of societies, governments, and most relevant stakeholders. Too often, more

attention has been paid to doubters than to facts. Therefore, the scenarios also show

that the longer the governments wait, the more difficult it will be to prevent severe

climate damage and the greater will be the technical and economic challenges that

will be encountered in the energy system transformation.

The coarse regional resolution of such global scenarios does not allow sufficient

account to be taken of sub-regional differences in energy demand and the character-

istic and favourable possibilities of sustainable supply. However, it can provide

rather fundamental insight into basic technical and structural possibilities and

requirements of a target-oriented pathway. Our results clearly reveal and quantita-

tively describe that the coming years will be most critical regarding a successful

energy transition because for both parts of the energy transition—efficiency

improvement/demand reduction and the implementation of new technologies—

huge investments and fundamental changes in producing, distributing, and consum-

ing energy will be needed. Such transformation processes must be analysed and

planned carefully under the complex economic and societal framework conditions

of each region, down to the country, sub-country, and community levels. Such anal-

yses can then form the basis for the further investigation of the economic implica-

tions of these pathways.

Another limitation of this approach is that the economic, technical, and market

assumptions made probably have limited consistency. Carbon, fuel, and technology

costs are assumed independently of the assumptions regarding overall economic

development and the final energy demand. It also remains unclear to what extent the

energy transition will change the overall material demand and activity of the manu-

facturing industry. Furthermore, which economic framework conditions and market

mechanisms will be necessary for rapid decarbonisation remain largely unclear, as

is whether the current market mechanisms are capable of supporting the fundamen-

tal paradigm shift of this target-oriented energy transition.

**13.1.7 Key Findings—Power Sector Analysis**

Although there are significant differences across all the regions and sub-regions

analysed, there are some similarities:

Increasing loads: The loads in all regions will increase significantly between 2020

```
and 2050, due to increased electrification of the transport and, to some extent, the
heating sectors. Higher loads will require the adaptation of power-lines and
```

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```
477
```

```
transformer stations, especially on distribution grids where electric vehicles are
most likely to be charged.
```

Increasing reverse power flows: Almost all regions will have periods of negative

```
residual load, when generation is higher than the required load within a specific
period of time. This leads to reversed power flow, and the generated electricity
must be transported to other regions. The dominant power-generation technolo-
gies are wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). Solar PV is mainly connected to the
distribution grid and export requires that the electricity must be able to flow from
low- to medium-voltage levels, which requires adaptation at transformer
stations.
```

Ratio between maximum variable generation capacity and maximum load: The

```
results presented in Chap. 8 suggest that a ratio of 180% variable renewable
capacity to the maximum load represents the optimum relationship. If the capac-
ity were higher, short-term peaks would appear more frequently, which would
lead to higher curtailment, or high storage and transmission demands. Example:
The maximum load of a region is 100 GW and the installed capacity of wind and
solar PV combined is 180 GW. Short-term peaks are relatively rare, and curtail-
ment is below 10% of the total annual generation potential. If the variable power
generation were above 200 GW, while the load remained at 100 GW, the curtail-
ment rates would increase significantly, to 15% and higher.
```

Technology variety reduces storage demand: The combination of solar PV and wind

```
leads to a lower storage demand than does a solar- or wind-dominated supply
scenario. The relative interaction between the available wind and solar resources,
not just in regard to day and night, but also seasonally, will reduce the storage
demand in all regions. Therefore, the levelized cost of electricity generation can-
not be seen in isolation. Even if, for example, wind is more expensive than solar
PV in one region, a combination of wind and solar will lead to a reduction in
storage demand and lower systems costs.
```

Variety in storage technology and sector coupling: The combination of battery and

```
hydro pump storage technology and the conversion of the gas sector to hydrogen
and synthetic fuels will be beneficial. The hydrogen produced can be used for the
management of demand, and hydrogen-fuelled power plants can provide valu-
able dispatch services.
```

**13.1.8 Limitations and Further Research Requirement—**

**Power Sector Analysis**

Measured load curves for regions, countries, or states/provinces are often unavail-

able and, in some countries, are even classified information. Therefore, it was not

always possible to compare the calculated loads with actual current actual. However,

the comparison of 2020 calculations with current maximum loads for regions and

countries with published data showed that the calculations were within a  ±  10%

range. However, verification was not possible for several regions. Therefore, our

analysis may over- or underestimate the current loads and therefore the future

[^13]: Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations

478

projections of loads as well. Therefore, the optimal ratio of maximum load to
installed variable capacity requires further research.
More research is also required to verify the thesis of an optimal ratio between the
variable generation and maximum load, because the sample size of this study was
not sufficient to ensure validity. Furthermore, the optimal mix of solar and wind
requires better meteorological data and actual measured load profiles. Access to
more detailed data to calculate more case studies is vital to determining the possible
optimal combination of wind and solar.

**13.1.9 Key Findings—Non-energy Scenarios**

The key finding of the land-use-related emission scenarios is that a dedicated con-
certed effort to sequester carbon by reforestation and forest restoration could re-
establish the terrestrial carbon stock of pre-industrial times. That would undoubtedly
come with multiple co-benefits, but would not be without challenges. After all, there
is a reason why humans in the various corners of the planet pursued deforestation,
whether for short-term and short-sighted gains or to establish agricultural areas that
fed an increasing population. Therefore, land-use conflicts and trade offs are an
inherent part of future mitigation actions, whether CO[^2]: sequestration is pursued by
reforestation sequestration or by some biomass and CCS use. Nevertheless, the
important result of this study is that the addition of land-use CO[^2]: and other GHG
emission pathways to energy-related scenarios yields scenarios that stay below or

get below 1.5 °C warming without a reliance on massive net negative CO[^2]: emission
potentials towards the second half of this century.

Going beyond the land-use CO[^2]: emission pathways that we sketched for a series
of sequestration options, we also designed trajectories for all the other GHGs and
aerosols. An unprecedented wealth of scenario information is now available thanks
to the recent concerted efforts of the larger integrated assessment community.
Designing a novel method here, the Generalized Quantile Walk method, we were
able to distil non-CO[^2]: pathways from this rich scenario database—in a way that
respects the correlations and dependencies between energy-related CO[^2]: and other
gas emissions. This is not only a new methodological advance in scenario research,
but also key to the proper estimation of the climate effects of the energy-related CO2
scenarios designed in the main part of this study.

**13.1.10 Limitations and Further Research Requirement—**
**Non-energy Scenarios**

There are a number of limitations associated with the derived non-energy-related
emission trajectories. Possibly the most important opportunity for future research
will involve a more fine-grained look at land-use-based sequestration options in

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

various countries and biomes. This study assumed only a rather coarse approxima-
tion of the available land areas, sequestration rates, and cumulative changes in land
carbon stocks to estimate the potential and time trajectories of those reforestation,
forest restoration, agroforestry, and other land-based sequestration options.
In terms of the non-CO[^2]: emission trajectories, this study relied heavily on the
collective wisdom embodied within a large set of literature-reported scenarios.

Although we have designed probably the most advanced method to distil that

knowledge into emission trajectories that are consistent with our energy-related

pathways, this meta-analytical approach is not without its limitations. In particular,

a bottom-up energy-system and land-use/agricultural model must be able to esti-

mate methane and N[^2]:O emissions from various agricultural activities in a more
coherent way, which could provide results on a regional level. Such regionally and

sectorally specific information would, in turn, allow the examination of various
mitigation options for non-CO[^2]: emissions. This bottom-up modelling capacity is
missing from our meta-analytical approach.

**13.1.11 Key Findings—Employment Analysis**

The occupational employment analysis was developed in 2018 to improve the data-
base for the ‘just transition’ concept. Not only is the number of jobs that will be
created or lost as a result of a global or regional energy transition important, but also
the specific occupations that will be to develop a socially sound transition. This
analysis breaks new grounds because very little information has been available.
However, the results indicate that even within the seven occupation types, job losses
are the exception and almost all trades will gain more jobs.
Very specialized jobs, such as machine operators in coal mines, will be lost and
there will be no replacement. Therefore, a detailed analysis of all sectors is required
to identify those highly specialized tasks and to develop re-training possibilities.

**13.1.12 Limitations and Further Research Requirement—**
**Employment Analysis**

The data available on the detailed employment requirements for renewable energies
are very limited. Although there are some data for solar PV and onshore and off-
shore wind, there are almost none for concentrated solar power plants or geothermal
energy. Furthermore, occupational surveys of the heating and energy efficiency sec-
tors are required.

**13.1.13 Key Findings—Mineral Resource Analysis**

Lithium sees the highest projected increase from mined ore of around 40 times cur-
rent production to above 80 times current production should future technologies be
introduced without recycling.
Cumulative primary lithium demand by 2050 for the majority of scenarios is
above current reserves of lithium except for the “potential recycling” scenario but
less than known resources. The scenarios anticipate a scale up in resource explora-
tion, discovery and production for primary resources to meet demand—assuming
lithium-ion batteries continue to dominate as the chemistry of choice. It is important
that future mines be responsibly developed and that battery designs be compatible
with circular-economy thinking. Significant infrastructure for reuse and recycling
will need to be developed to achieve high rates of lithium recycling.
For cobalt, future scenarios exceed currently known reserves and approach cur-

rently known resources in 2050. Given the concentrated supply source from the

Democratic Republic of Congo, this will continue to keep pressure on exploring

alternative battery chemistries and on increasing cobalt recycling. Attention must

continue to be paid to reducing the social and environmental impacts of supply

whilst supporting development noting the significant adverse impacts on human and

environmental health associated with cobalt mining. While the value of cobalt in EV

battery recycling is already an important component of the recycling economics

because of supply limitations, the social and environmental challenges provide a

further driver for increasing recycling.

For silver, the potential of materials efficiency (using less silver per GW solar PV

panel) has potential to reduce demand owing to the long lifetimes of PV panels.

Under some scenarios using future technology with recycling, the levels of silver

demand are similar to current production.

**13.1.14 Limitations and Further Research Requirement—**
**Mineral Resource Analysis**

This study focuses only on the metal demand for renewable energy (generation and
storage) and transport and does not consider other demands for these metals.
However, it is expected that with the increase in renewable energy, renewable energy
technologies will consume a greater share of these metals and it is anticipated that
this growth will have significant influence on overall market dynamics, including
influencing prices, which may feedback to efforts to reduce material intensity and
invest in reuse and recycling infrastructure.
Promoting the transition to circular economy for both renewable energy and
resource cycles; and adopting a systems view that considers available supply as well
as social and environmental factors is critically important. To support sustainable
development goals, both the primary and secondary sources of the resources

required to underpin this renewable energy transformation needs to be stewarded as

the supply chains develop. The high total demand requirements for energy metals,

demonstrates the importance of redesigning technologies and systems to eliminate

the adverse social and environmental supply chain impacts, to promote long-life

products, and to actively encourage efficient material use in both energy and trans-

port sectors.

**13.2 Policy Recommendations by Sector**

To implement the 2.0 °C or 1.5 °C Scenario will require a significant shift in current

policies. This section documents the policy measures that have been assumed for

the scenarios presented in the previous chapters, as well as policy measures known

to be successful. The global legal frameworks and regulations differ significantly on

national and community levels. Therefore, only the functions and aims of suggested

policy measures can be discussed, but not how they can be integrated into current

jurisdictions. That said, it is assumed that the Paris Agreement will be the global

basis.

**13.2.1 Energy**

The energy sector is not a homogeneous sector but is highly diverse. Therefore,

policy measures can follow different strategies and can address different aspects and

stakeholders. The supply side can be divided into the main sub-sectors of electricity,

heating, and fuel supply. The demand side can be broken down further into build-

ings, industry, and transport. However, because all these sub-sectors are directly or

indirectly connected via resources and energy markets, policy interventions can

have different effects.

The basic principles for the development of the 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios

derive from the long-term experiences with scenario development of the authorship

team, and have led to a ‘seven-step logic’.

This logic extends from the definition of the final state of the energy systems in

the long-term future to the key drivers of the energy demand and the energy effi-

ciency potentials, a technological analysis of supply and demand and the market

development potential, and the specific policy measures required to implement a

theoretical concept in the real market-place.

The seven steps are:

1. Define the maximum carbon budget and other targets, milestones, and con-

straints to achieve the climate goal;

2. Define the renewable energy resource potentials and limits within a space-

constrained environment;

[^13]: Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations

482

3. Identify the economic and societal drivers of demand;
4. Define the efficiency potentials and energy intensities by energy service and

sector;

5. Establish time lines and narratives for the technology implementation on the

end-user and supply sides;

6. Estimate the infrastructure needs, generation costs, and other effects;
7. Identify the required policies and discuss the policy options.

**13.2.1.1 General Energy Policies**

The energy sector requires both very specific measures, such as grid codes and effi-

ciency standards, and overarching measures. International collaboration and co-

operation are required to define and implement mandatory standards and to

effectively develop energy policy and its regulative interventions. The most impor-

tant interventions to accelerate the energy transition are:

• Renewable energy targets and incentives for their deployment and expansion;
• Internalization of external costs by carbon tax or surcharge;
• Phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies;
• Accelerated replacement of fossil and inefficient technologies.

Renewable energy targets are vital to accelerate the deployment of renewable

energy. Experiences of the past two decades clearly show the effectiveness of renew-

able energy policy development. The Renewable Policy Network for the 21st

Century (REN21) states in their annual market analysis, Renewables 2018, that

“Targets remain one of the primary means for policy makers to express their com-

mitment to renewable energy deployment. Targets are enacted for economy-wide

energy development as well as for specific sectors” (REN21-GSR-[^2018]:). To achieve

these goals, innovation processes must be initiated, markets developed, and

investment stimulated. For the latter, auctions and feed-in tariffs have proven suit-

able. It is important in this context to guarantee investment security and to enable

long-term but appropriate revenues.

Climate change leads to a number of types of environmental damage. Carbon

emissions lead to climate change. Therefore, it is vital to put a price on carbon to

internalize the external costs. Carbon-pricing schemes can be established as _cap-_

_and-trade_ schemes or taxes. Carbon pricing is not sufficient on its own to achieve

the objective of the Paris Agreement, and many leading international agencies and

institutions argue that a much more concerted and widespread global take-up of

carbon pricing will be necessary (Carbon Tracker [^2018]:). To make carbon pricing an

efficient measure, the price of carbon must be sufficient to reflect the environmental

damage it causes and it must be reliable. Therefore, a minimum price should be

implemented to provide planning security.

Subsidies of fossil fuels counteract any efforts to make energy efficiency and

renewable energy competitive. According to the International Energy Agency, the

total amount of global fossil fuel subsidies was estimated to be around US$260 bil-

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

lion in 2016 (IEA-DB [^2018]:). The governments of the G20 and the Asia-Pacific

Economic Cooperation (APEC) reached an agreement to “_rationalize and phase out_

_over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful con-_

_sumption_” (OECD-IEA [^2018]:).

Setting legally binding national targets for 100% renewable energy pathways

will lead to an orderly phase-out of fossil fuels. This is vital in planning the socio-

economic effects of the energy transition (see Chap. [^10]:). Supporting measures to

achieve the replacement of fossil and inefficient technologies and energy sources

will be necessary because targets and economic incentives may not be sufficient in

all areas. Regulatory interventions for the decommissioning and replacement of

facilities are a way to stop opposing business scenarios and to overcome the inertia

of consumers and investors. Moreover, economic policy measures and the clearer

definitions and stringent enforcement of international standards will accelerate the

implementation of the best available technologies in the industry.

Both a minimum price on carbon and the immediate phase-out of fossil fuel

subsidies must be implemented in order to support the global energy transition.

Policy support for technology innovation is another important measure to create the

basis for the energy transition processes.

**13.2.1.2 Policies for Buildings Sector Decarbonisation**

To reduce the energy demands of existing building stock and new buildings, con-

stantly most stringent energy demand standards (= _building energy codes_) are

required for all building types and across all countries. The goal must be to achieve

(near) zero-energy buildings, so that each building reduces its heating and cooling

demand to the lowest possible level and aims to supply the remaining energy with

on-site renewable energy technologies, such as solar collectors, electric heaters,

advanced bioenergy and heat pumps, or with low-temperature heating networks.

Mandatory municipal heating plans are an appropriate way to define an efficient

strategy that balances insulation, local heating systems, and the grid-connected heat

supply in regions with a significant space-heating demand. An analysis of building

energy codes in 15 countries (Young [^2014]:) distinguished between residential and

commercial buildings and listed six technical requirement categories, ranging from

heating and cooling requirements and the insulation of the building envelope to the

building design. However, building energy codes must be mandatory and include

existing building stock as well as new buildings. The most urgent need for action is

in developing countries, where the rapid growth in building construction can be

expected over the next decades. Economic measures to increase heating/cooling

costs, e.g., by introducing fossil energy taxes or surcharges or by phasing-out fossil

fuel subsidies, could support efforts to save energy. However, they must be accom-

panied by social policies.

[^13]: Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations

484

**13.2.1.3 Policies for more-Efficient Electrical Appliances**

To reduce the electricity demand of consumer goods in households and equipment

in buildings, the efficiency standards for electrical appliances, all forms of informa-

tion and communication technologies (computers, smart devices, screens, televi-

sions, etc.), white goods (washing machines, dryers, dishwasher, fridges, and

freezers), electrical building equipment for thermal comfort, and lighting technolo-

gies are required. These efficiency standards must be dynamic and designed to sup-

port competition for the most efficient design. The Japanese front runner system

(IEA-PM [^2018]:) is a positive example of dynamic efficiency standards. Labelling

programmes and purchase subsidies for the best available technologies can support

the replacement of old devices with the most efficient technologies. Measures for

training and capacity building are also essential, most importantly in non-OECD

countries.

**13.2.1.4 Policies for the Transport Sector**

As well as resolute electrification and further technical advances in all transport

modes, decision-makers in politics and the urban planning context must carefully

steer transport habits and infrastructure development toward a climate-friendly

transport system. Their aim should be to promote the use of less ecologically prob-

lematic transport modes. This can be done by, for example, the introduction of fiscal

and regulatory measures that effectively reduce the subsidization of currently

untaxed and internalisation of external costs.

```
In parallel, environmentally less harmful transportation modes should be incen-
```

tivized. Investments must also be channelled towards highly productive and energy-

efficient passenger and freight railway systems and towards a dense network of

battery recharging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructures for road vehicles. In the

passenger car and truck context, direct subsidies or tax incentives for electric

vehicles will speed up the electrification of fleets. CO[^2]: taxation, road tolls, and con-
gestion charges could be applied, in addition to parking-space management schemes

to reduce road traffic and thus internal combustion engines in a transition to car-
reduced cities. The assignment of parking lots and driving lanes exclusively to elec-
tric cars will speed the phase-out of internal combustion engines.
In aviation, measures could include the taxation of jet fuel and CO[^2]:, the applica-
tion of an emission trading scheme on the direct and indirect climate effects of flight
at high altitudes. Direct and indirect public subsidies for carriers and airports should
be abolished (investment and operational grants should be reduced and funding
should be allocated to a competitive and attractive rail system).
All measures curtailing the use of individual passenger transport should be
accompanied by the promotion of ubiquitous, fast, comfortable, and price-
competitive public transport systems, ride and car sharing and on-demand services
(especially for less densely populated semi-urban and rural areas). Last but not
least, an attractive and safe infrastructure for bicycles and e-bikes will help to reduce

```
S. Teske et al.
```

```

```

emissions and other unwanted side-effects of transport. In this arena, Copenhagen

and Amsterdam are at the cycling forefront and inspiring more and more cities in

following their path. Cities must also curtail tendencies to urban sprawl and ‘rein-

vent’ the compact city ideal, which means becoming pedestrian-friendly cities, thus

reducing the need for motorized individual mobility and freeing up space for recre-

ation and green spaces.

Cities in developed countries should aim to transform their transport systems

(often) from passenger-car-centred urban structures and policies towards pedes-

trian-, bike-, and mass-transport-friendly environments. The often densely popu-

lated emerging megacities in the upcoming economic powerhouses of Africa, Latin

America, and Asia should invest, right from the start, in resilient public-transport-

oriented urban structures instead of relying too strongly on individual passenger car

traffic, as the OECD countries have done in the past.

**13.2.1.5 Policies for the Industry Sector**

Policies to achieve the implementation of new highly efficient technologies and to

replace fossil fuel use in industry must be defined region-wide or even on the global

level, and will require stringent and regulatory implementation. Economic incen-

tives, national initiatives, and voluntary agreements with industrial branches will

most probably not, by themselves, see the achievement of a rapid technological

change. Concrete standards and requirements must be defined at a very detailed

level, covering as far as possible all technologies and their areas of application. The

systematic implementation of already-identified best-available technologies could

begin in the next few years. Mandatory energy management systems should be

introduced to identify efficiency potentials and to monitor efficiency progress. The

sustainability features along process chains and material flows must also be taken

into account when designing political measures. Particular attention must be paid to

the material efficiency of both production processes and their products, because this

can open up major energy efficiency potentials and reduce other environmental

effects. Public procurement policies and guidelines can help to establish new mar-

kets and to demonstrate new more-efficient products and opportunities. The effec-

tiveness of policy interventions must be assessed by independent experts and the

further development of efficiency programs and measures will require ongoing

coordination by independent executive agencies. The public provision of low-

interest loans, investment risk management, and tax exemptions for energy-efficient

technologies and processes will significantly support technological changes and

incentivize the huge investments required. Knowledge transfer between sectors and

countries can be achieved through networks initiated and coordinated by govern-

ments. Public funding for research and development activities with regard to tech-

nological innovation, low-carbon solutions, and their process integration will be

vital to push the technological limits further. Innovative approaches to the realiza-

tion of material cycles and recycling options, the recovery of industrial waste heat,

[^13]: Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations

486

and low-carbon raw materials and process routes in industry must also be identified

and implemented.

**13.2.1.6 Political Framework for Power Markets**

The 2.0  °C and 1.5  °C Scenarios will lead to 100% renewable electricity supply,

with significant shares of variable power generation. The traditional electricity mar-

ket framework has been developed for central suppliers operating dispatchable and

limited dispatchable (‘_base load_’) thermal power plants. The electricity markets of

the future will be dominated by variable generation without marginal/fuel costs. The

power system will also require the built-up and economic operation of a combina-

tion of dispatch generation, storage, and other system services whose operation will

be conditioned by renewable electricity feed-ins. For both reasons, a significantly

different market framework is urgently needed, in which the technologies can be

operated economically and refinanced. Renewable electricity should be guaranteed

priority access to the grid. Access to the exchange capacity available at any given

moment should be fully transparent and the transmission of renewable electricity

must always have preference. Furthermore, the design of distribution and transmis-

sion networks, particularly for interconnections and transformer stations, should be

guided by the objective of facilitating the integration of renewables and to achieve a

100% renewable electricity system.

To establish fair and equal market conditions, the ownership of electrical grids

should be completely disengaged from the ownership of power-generation and sup-

ply companies. To encourage new businesses, relevant grid data must be made avail-

able from transmission and distribution system operators. This will require

establishing communication standards and data protection guidelines for smart

grids. Legislation to support and expand demand-side management is required to

create new markets for the flexibility services for renewable electricity integration.

Public funding for research and development is required to further develop and

implement technologies that allow variable power integration, such as smart grid

technology, virtual power stations, low-cost storage solutions, and responsive

demand-side management. Finally, a policy framework that supports the electrifica-

tion and sector coupling of the heating and transport sectors is urgently needed for

a successful and cost-efficient transition process.
