## Why is Proper Grammar so Important?

**1. Proper grammar is essential to being understood.** Writing is an essential form of
daily communication. Between emails, text messages, reports, papers, and tweets,
everyone writes. Proper grammar ensures that your message is not lost. You might
have the greatest message in the world, but that message will lose its impact if you litter
the message with grammatical errors. A misplaced comma or a typo might not seem
like a big deal, but it can change the entire meaning of your sentence. For example,
imagine a friend asked which company you used for your new carpet installation, and
you responded with one of the following emails.

```
 We used Lowes for our carpet installation. Great! The message is clear.
```

```
 We sued Lowes for our carpet installation. The message is clear, but the
meaning is very different. Two letters were reversed in the word used, and it
changed the entire meaning. Typos can sometimes form correctly spelled words
with very different meanings.
```

2. Correct grammar reveals the writer’s attention to detail, competency, and
professionalism. If it seems like the writer is too distracted or sloppy to learn the rules
of grammar, it begs the question, where else are they distracted and sloppy. Your
written words are representing you. You want the reader to focus on your message and
not your mistakes.

Proper grammar is essential for formal writing in the academic world and in the
business world. In school, many instructors will deduct points from an assignment for
each grammatical error. Those points add up quickly and can lower your grade
significantly. In business, resumes and cover letters are your tickets to an interview. If
your cover letter is filled with grammar errors, it is not likely that you will even receive an
interview. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, said:

```
“If it takes someone more than 20 years to notice how to properly use “it’s,” then
that’s not a learning curve I’m comfortable with. So, even in this hyper-
competitive market, I will pass on a great programmer who cannot write.
Applicants who don’t think writing is important are likely to think lots of other
(important) things also aren’t important. After all, sloppy is as sloppy does.”
```

3. In business writing you are representing your company and yourself. No
company wants their employees to send out messages filled with grammar errors. It
makes the company look sloppy and unprofessional. Studies have shown that a single
spelling mistake on a website can cut online sales revenue in half. It might seem like a
small error, but it reveals the company‟s attention to detail. In February 2014 Bing
announced that websites containing grammar errors would show up lower on the search
rankings than companies with proper grammar. Companies want to appear in the top ten
rankings on search engines because it directs more business to their own website. Duane
Forrester of Bing said, “Why would an engine show a page of content with errors higher in
the rankings when other pages of error free content exist to serve the searcher?”
**4. The ability to write well puts the writer in charge.** By prioritizing your ideas, you can
guide the reader through your writing, emphasizing points that you deem important. By
doing this, you can emphasize your main point.

#### Common Errors in Business Writing

1. Effective writers should not depend on spell-check programs to catch all of the
proofreading errors. Spell-check will catch spelling errors, typos, and basic grammar
errors; however, it cannot replace concentrated proofreading. Spell-check only catches
words that are not in the English language. If your typo happens to create a word in the
English language, spell-check will not catch it. The meaning might be completely different.
Spell-check does not know the difference between a person _definitely attending_ or
_defiantly attending_ , between being stranded on a _desert island_ or a _dessert island_ , or
between _my dear_ or _my deer_. Both options are spelled correctly, but they have
dramatically different meanings.

Proofread your documents thoroughly. It is helpful to read your documents out loud. If you
read it in your head, you often read what you meant to say instead of the information you
wrote. Have someone else proofread your document too.

2. Effective writing should be comprehendible and enjoyable to your target
audience. Have you ever become frustrated reading an instruction manual because the
directions were confusing? Clearly, the writer did not accurately gauge the target
audience. If the reader is throwing the manual down in frustration, then the writer has
failed. How can you avoid this?

**Do not use technical terms or acronyms unless you are certain that the reader is**
**familiar with these terms.** If you must use the term, be sure to define it in your
document. You want your message to be clear and not frustrating to your reader.

**Do not use slang, text language, hashtags, emoticons, or jargon in formal writing.**
Many people do not understand these terms, and find it frustrating to receive
correspondence containing it. This type of communication is acceptable in informal
communication, but is too casual and informal for business communication or academic
writing. Imagine receiving the following email from your manager, “OMG! U will b xited 4
2morow! :)” Would you take your manager seriously? The message is too casual, and
makes the writer look amateurish and unprofessional.

#### The Eight Parts of Speech

Before you can play a sport, you must learn the rules of the game. The same theory
applies to writing with proper grammar. Before you can write effectively, you must learn
the rules. Let‟s meet the starting lineup.

**Nouns**

A noun names a person, place, thing, feeling, or idea. Nouns can be as specific as
Starbucks coffee or as abstract as freedom and happiness. Nouns are broken into two
groups: proper nouns and common nouns. **Proper nouns are capitalized**, and they refer
to specific things. **Common nouns are not capitalized**, and they refer to general things.

```
Nouns Proper Common
```

```
People Fred Smith student
```

```
Dr. Sam Jones doctor
```

```
Mrs. Mary Johnson instructor
```

```
Places Seattle city
```

```
Sea-Tac Airport airport
```

```
United States country
```

```
Things iPhone cell phone
```

```
New York Times newspaper
```

```
Thanksgiving, Christmas holidays
```

**Pronouns**
Pronouns take the place of a noun in a sentence and provide efficiency to your writing.
Without pronouns, writing becomes bogged down in nouns. For example:

**Without pronouns:** Mary sent Fred a text message to remind Fred to pick up dinner
for Mary and Fred. (Difficult to read)
**With pronouns:** Mary sent Fred a text message to remind him to pick up dinner for
them. (More efficient)

Pronouns can act as the subject of a sentence (I, he, she, they, it) or the object of a
verb (me, them, us). Pronouns will be covered more in Chapter 4.

**Verbs**
Verbs show the action or a state of being. **Every sentence must have a verb to be**
**complete**. Without verbs, the subjects of sentences wouldn‟t be doing anything. Verbs
are further broken down into three categories: action verbs, helping verbs, and linking
verbs.

**Action verbs** describe the action of the subject. _Run, jump, climb, read, think,_ and _cook_
are all examples of action verbs.

**Linking verbs** describe a state of being of the subject. The action is more descriptive
and connective. _Is, are, seems, look, become,_ and _feel_ are all linking verbs.

**Helping verbs** do not show action in a sentence. They do exactly what their name
implies. They help other verbs. Helping verbs work with a main verb to form a verb
phrase. Common helping verbs are the following: _am, are, were, has, was, will, have,_
and _had_.

```
 Mary has passed everyone in the marathon.
 Mary will win the race.
```

Verbs will be covered in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. For now, it is important to be
able to identify if a sentence has a verb. A sentence is not complete without a verb.

**Adjectives**
Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns. Without adjectives, our
language would be flat and boring. Adjectives often add information that explains which
one, how many, what color, and what kind.

```
 Orange cat (what color?)
 One cat (how many?)
 Fluffy cat (which one?)
 Siamese cat (what kind?)
```

These are all adjectives that are working to describe the cat. Adjectives usually appear
in front of the nouns and pronouns that they describe, but they can also appear after a
linking verb.

```
 The cat is orange.
 The cat is fluffy.
```

_A, an_, and _the_ form a unique group of adjectives called **articles.** These will be
discussed further in Chapter 7. For now, just know that articles are part of the adjective
team.

**Adverbs**
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Adverbs describe
how, when, where, or to what extent the action takes place.

```
 Mary ran quickly to win the race. (How did she run?)
 Mary‟s legs will be sore tomorrow. (When will her legs be sore?)
 Mary‟s family waited for her there. (Where did they wait?)
 She was very relieved to have a few days of rest. (To what extent?)
```

Adverbs often end in –ly, but some of the most common adverbs do not. _There, then,_
_now, sometimes, very, today,_ and _inside_ are all common adverbs that do not end in –ly.
Adverbs (not adjectives) describe and modify verbs. The word _verb_ is even inside the
word _adverb_ in case you forget.

**Prepositions**
Prepositions join nouns and pronouns to other words in the sentence. Prepositions
show a relationship between words. Prepositions often show a relationship of space and
time.
The name itself has the word _position_ in it. A preposition is a short word that will reveal
a position in time or space. If you lost your keys, think of all of the places (positions)
your keys could be. They could be _on_ the table, _under_ the couch, _between_ the books,

_with_ your gym clothes, _at_ the office, or _behind_ the refrigerator. A preposition can also
reveal a more abstract relationship.

```
 Mary is against the new law, but Fred is for it.
```

Prepositions are usually very short words. Some of the most common prepositions are
_at, by, for, from, in, of to,_ and _with_.

**Conjunctions**
Conjunctions are the big joiners of the grammar world. They join words, phrases, and
clauses. The most common conjunctions are _and, but,_ and _or._

```
 Mary and Fred enjoy drinking coffee.
 Mary drank coffee, but Fred drank tea.
 Either Fred or Mary needs to run to the store.
```

**Interjections**
Interjections are the interrupters of the group. Interjections express strong feelings and
emotions. When these expressions stand alone as a sentence, an exclamation point is
used. When the emotion is not as strong, the interjection is set apart with a comma.

```
 Wow! Did you see the race? (Interjection standing alone as a sentence)
 Oh well, I had planned to order the soup, but they are sold out. (Interjection set
apart with a comma)
```

Interjections show strong emotion and excitement. Avoid overusing interjections in
formal writing. Too many interjections and exclamation points give the impression that
the writer is shouting.

**Team Grammar**
Let‟s review our grammar team.

**Nouns/Pronouns**: represent people, places, things, and ideas
**Verbs:** show the action
**Adjectives/Adverbs**: the describers
**Prepositions/Conjunctions:** the joiners
**Interjections:** the interrupters

**Chapter 2**

## Sentences

To write effectively, it is important to understand how to write complete sentences.

**What is a sentence?** All sentences must begin with a capital letter and end with a
punctuation mark. This is a grammar rule that does not have any exceptions. In addition
to a capital letter and a punctuation mark, a complete sentence must contain a subject,
a predicate, and it must make sense. The **simple subject** is a noun or pronoun that is
performing the action in the sentence. A quick way to find the simple subject is to ask
whom or what the sentence is about. The **simple predicate** is the verb or verb phrase
that explains what the subject is doing. The predicate gives the sentence action or
shows a state of being.

```
Simple Subject Simple Predicate
```

```
Mary ran.
```

```
Cars drive.
```

These are very basic sentences, but they are still complete sentences. They fulfill all the
requirements for being a complete sentence. Most people do not spend their time
writing only two-word sentences. Our language would be very choppy and inefficient if
we spoke this way all of the time. What happens when we add other words to the
sentence?

```
Complete Subject Complete Predicate
```

```
Mary and Sarah ran the race.
```

```
Cars on the freeway drive slowly during rush hour.
```

The **complete subject** is the simple subject and all of its modifiers. The **complete**
**predicate** is the simple predicate plus all of its modifiers. The simple subjects and
simple predicates are underlined. The simple subject can be more than one noun. In the
first sentence, both _Sarah_ and _Mary_ are the simple subjects of the sentence.
In order to be a complete sentence, the sentence must make sense. The sentence
must form a complete thought on its own. If the sentence does not make sense without
adding some additional words, then you have written a fragment.

**Complete Sentence Checklist**
**A sentence must have all of the following to be complete:**

1. A sentence must start with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark.
2. A sentence must have a verb.
3. A sentence must have a subject.
4. A sentence must make sense.

#### Sentence Types

All sentences must begin with a capital letter, but they can end with one of three
different types of punctuation. The punctuation mark is based upon what type of
sentence it is. There are four types of sentences: statements, questions, commands,
and exclamations.

**Statements** A statement tells something and ends with a period. Sometimes these
are called declarative sentences because the sentence declares something.

```
 It is raining outside.
 I left my umbrella in my car.
```

**Questions** A direct question asks something and needs to end with a question mark.

```
 Is it still raining?
 Is it going to rain tomorrow?
```

**Commands** A command gives an order and ends with a period. If the command is
very strong, then it can end with an exclamation point. Most of the time, the subject in a
command is not stated. Instead, it is understood that the subject is _you_.

```
 Check the weather for tomorrow. (You should check the weather for tomorrow.)
 Take your umbrella. (You should take your umbrella.)
```

**Exclamations** Exclamations show strong feelings or excitement. An exclamation
can be a complete sentence, but it does not have to be a complete sentence. An
exclamation does not have to have a subject and a predicate. In exclamations, often the
subject and the predicate are implied.

```
 Wow! It is raining very hard!
 Oh no! He forgot his umbrella!
```

Do not overuse exclamations in formal writing. Exclamations show a lot of emotion and
give the impression that the writer is shouting.

#### Phrases and Clauses

**Phrases**
A phrase is a group of words without a subject and a verb. Phrases are part of a
sentence, but they cannot stand alone as complete sentences.

```
Phrases
```

```
on the roof prepositional phrase
```

```
from another planet prepositional phrase
```

```
could have gone verb phrase
```

```
to study the chapter infinitive phrase
```

```
the coffee that she drank noun phrase
```

It isn‟t necessary to memorize each type of phrase, but it is important to recognize that
each of these phrases could not be a complete sentence on their own.

**Clauses**

A clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb. They come in two forms:
independent clauses and dependent clauses. **Independent clauses** can stand on their
own as sentences. A simple sentence is one independent clause. An independent
clause has a subject, a verb, and it makes sense.

A **dependent clause** also has a subject and a verb, but it does not make sense on its
own. A dependent clause is a type of sentence fragment. Dependent clauses often
begin with the words _because, although, after, when, if,_ and _as_. These are called
subordinating conjunctions, and they are covered further in Chapter 9.

**The following words and phrases are often used to introduce dependent clauses:**

```
after even though unless
although if until
as no matter how when
as if now that whenever
as though once where
because than wherever
before that whether
even if though while
```

If you begin a sentence with one of these words, it can turn an independent clause into
a dependent clause. Once the clause is dependent, it is no longer a complete sentence.
A dependent clause is a fragment, and great writers avoid fragments. Dependent
clauses leave the reader waiting for the rest of the sentence. It is the equivalent of
setting up a great joke and leaving off the punch line.

```
Independent Clause Dependent Clause
```

```
The cat ran up the stairs. Because the cat ran up the stairs.
```

```
The sun came out at noon. Although the sun came out at noon.
```

```
The students arrived on time. When the students arrived on time.
```

**How can you fix dependent clauses?** There are two ways to fix a dependent clause.
You can remove the subordinating conjunction (_although, because, if, when_). Often just
removing that word will reveal an independent clause.

Another option is to attach the dependent clause to an independent clause. A
dependent clause needs an independent clause in order for the sentence to make
sense. In the following examples, the dependent clause precedes the independent
clause. Notice that the dependent clause does not make sense as its own sentence.
When the dependent clause joins an independent clause, the entire sentence makes
sense.

```
Dependent Clause Independent Clause
```

```
When the students arrived, the instructor handed out notes.
```

```
After she ordered, she waited patiently for her coffee.
```

```
If Fred cooks dinner, Mary washes the dishes.
```

**Punctuating Dependent Clauses** Did you notice the punctuation in the examples? If
a dependent clause appears before the independent clause in the sentence, add a
comma to separate the two clauses. If the dependent clause appears after the
dependent clause, no comma is needed.

```
Independent Clause Dependent Clause
```

```
The instructor handed out notes when the students arrived.
```

```
She waited patiently for her coffee after she ordered.
```

```
Mary washes the dishes if Fred cooks dinner.
```

#### Sentence Varieties

Have you ever written a paragraph and realized that every sentence looked the same?
That is a quick way to lull your reader to sleep. One way to fix the problem is to add
some variety to your sentence structure. Sentences come in four different varieties:

simple sentences, compound sentences, complex sentences, and compound-complex
sentences.

A **simple sentence** is exactly what its name implies; it is simple. A simple sentence
contains one independent clause. Simple sentences can be long or short, but they still
contain only one complete thought.

```
 Mary ran to the park. (one independent clause)
 Sarah went on vacation. (one independent clause)
 Dave‟s favorite places to visit are Paris, Las Vegas, New York, and Boston. (one
independent clause)
```

Simple sentences contain only one independent clause. Children‟s books are written
with simple sentences because they are easy to understand. Why do we need other
sentence varieties? Imagine that you received the following email:

```
 I went for a run. Now I am tired. I ran five miles.
```

While this email is grammatically correct and easy to understand, it sounds choppy and
stilted. Other sentence varieties help break up the choppiness of simple sentences.
Occasionally the choppiness of a simple sentence is exactly what the paragraph needs.
The choppiness can add emphasis to that sentence when added between other
sentence varieties.

```
 I went for a run, and now I am tired. I ran five miles. (Simple sentence following
compound sentence adds emphasis to simple sentence)
```

A **compound sentence** contains two independent clauses with related topics.
Compound sentences can be punctuated in three different ways. Two independent
clauses can be joined with a comma and a coordinating conjunction (_for, and, nor, but,_
_or, yet, so_). Two independent clauses can also be joined together with a semicolon.
Another option for joining two independent clauses is to use a conjunctive adverb. A
conjunctive adverb is an adverb that is acting like a conjunction by gluing together two
independent clauses. Conjunctive adverbs are preceded by a semicolon and followed
with a comma. We will look at them closer in Chapter 9.

```
 Sarah flew to Hawaii on Tuesday, but her suitcase arrived on Friday. (Two
independent clauses joined with a coordinating conjunction and a comma.)
 Sarah flew to Hawaii on Tuesday; her suitcase arrived on Friday. (Two
independent clauses joined with a semicolon.)
 Sarah flew to Hawaii on Tuesday; however, her suitcase arrived on Friday. (Two
independent clauses joined with a semicolon and a conjunctive adverb.)
```

A trick to remember all of the coordinating conjunctions is the acronym **FANBOYS**.
Each letter represents one of the coordinating conjunctions: **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et,
**S**o.

A **complex sentence** contains one independent clause and one dependent clause. The
punctuation changes depending on the order of the clauses. If the dependent clause
appears first, a comma is needed after the dependent clause. If the independent clause
appears first in the sentence, then no comma is needed.

```
 Because Sarah‟s suitcase was lost, she had to go shopping. (Dependent clause
appears first in the sentence, so a comma is needed between the clauses.)
 Sarah had to go shopping because her suitcase was lost. (Independent clause
appears first in the sentence, so no comma is needed between the clauses.)
```

A **compound-complex sentence** contains at least two independent clauses and one
dependent clause. These sentences can be very long, so do not overuse them.

```
 Although Sarah‟s luggage was lost, she enjoyed her vacation in Hawaii; she is
already planning her next trip.
```

#### Sentence Faults: Fragments, Comma Splices, and

#### Run-Ons

**Fragments**
Fragments are incomplete sentences. As the name implies, a fragment is just a piece of
the sentence. In formal writing, sentence fragments are frowned upon. A fragment is
often disguised as a complete sentence, but it is lacking one of the requirements for
being a complete sentence.

```
Fragment After the restaurant closed. They went to a movie.
```

```
Fixed After the restaurant closed, they went to a movie.
```

```
The fragment is fixed by joining it to the independent clause.
```

```
Fragment Mary plays many sports. Such as soccer, softball, and lacrosse.
```

```
Fixed Mary plays many sports such as soccer, softball, and lacrosse.
```

```
The fragment is fixed by joining it to the independent clause.
```

```
Fragment Due on Saturday, May 17.
```

```
Fixed The assignment is due on Saturday, May 17.
```

```
The fragment is fixed by adding a subject and a helping verb.
```

Fragments can sneak into your writing because they are often punctuated as if they
were complete sentences. Some sentence fragments can be fixed by changing the
punctuation and joining the fragment to a complete sentence. Other sentence fragments
require adding a verb or a subject to make them complete. How can you tell if your
sentence is a fragment? Run the sentence through the Complete Sentence Checklist
located at the beginning of the chapter. If the sentence does not meet all of the
requirements, then it is a sentence fragment.
**Fragments are often used in newspaper headlines and advertisements to grab the**
**reader’s attention. It is acceptable to use a sentence fragment in these cases.**

**Comma Splices**

Commas are such a handy piece of punctuation that sometimes writers try to give them
powers that they do not have. When two independent clauses are stuck together with a
comma, it is called a **comma splice**. Commas do not have the power to fuse two
independent clauses together. Luckily for writers, there are several ways to fix a comma
splice.

```
 Mary ordered coffee, Fred ordered a scone. (Comma splice)
 Mary ordered coffee, and Fred ordered a scone. (Fixed by adding a
coordinating conjunction)
 Mary ordered coffee. Fred ordered a scone. (Fixed by changing the sentence
to two independent sentences)
 Mary ordered coffee; Fred ordered a scone. (Fixed by changing the comma to
a semicolon)
 Mary ordered coffee; however, Fred ordered a scone. (Fixed by adding a
conjunctive adverb, a semicolon, and a comma)
```

**Run-On Sentences**

A run-on sentence does not mean that it is a long sentence. In fact, a run-on sentence
can be very short. A run-on sentence occurs when two independent clauses appear in a
sentence without proper internal punctuation. A run-on sentence just keeps going, when
it should be slowed down with punctuation. Run-on sentences can be fixed with the
same group of tricks that fixed the comma splice.

```
 Fred enjoys cooking he does not enjoy cleaning. (run-on sentence)
 Fred enjoys cooking. He does not enjoy cleaning. (Fixed by changing the
sentence to two independent sentences)
 Fred enjoys cooking, but he does not enjoy cleaning. (Fixed by adding a
comma and a coordinating conjunction)
 Fred enjoys cooking; he does not enjoy cleaning. (Fixed by adding a semicolon
between the independent clauses)
 Fred enjoys cooking; however, he does not enjoy cleaning. (Fixed by adding a
semicolon, a conjunctive adverb, and a comma)
```

**Chapter 3**

## Nouns

A **noun** represents a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns can name a specific place,
such as _Seattle_, or a general place, such as a _city_. Nouns can also name feelings and
thoughts. _Excitement, fear, anger, freedom,_ and _happiness_ are all nouns. Nouns work
as the subjects of sentences, as the objects of verbs, and as the objects of prepositions.
Nouns are divided into two categories: common nouns and proper nouns.

**Common nouns** name general people, places, and things. _City, coffee, lake, kayak,_
_tree, flower_, and _shoe_ are all common nouns. Common nouns are not capitalized.

**Proper nouns** name specific people, places, and things. _Mary, Fred, Seattle, New York_
_City_, and _Italy_ are all proper nouns.

```
Proper nouns Common nouns
```

```
The White House house
```

```
Mt. Rainier mountain
```

```
Pacific Ocean ocean
```

```
Thanksgiving holiday
```

```
Friday day
```

If you get confused, just ask yourself if the noun is referring to something specific.
Nouns that name specific people, places, and things are capitalized.

#### Making Nouns Plural

A **singular noun** names one person, place, or thing. _Student_ is an example of a
singular noun. What happens if more than one student shows up in the sentence? The
singular noun _student_ becomes the plural noun _students_. A **plural noun** names more
than one person, place, or thing. Do not use apostrophes to make nouns plural. This is
one of the most common grammatical errors.

```
 Most regular nouns become plural by adding an s.
tree trees
sock socks
book books
```

```
 Nouns that end in s, x, z, ch, sh, or z, add es.
dress dresses
tax taxes
lunch lunches
wash washes
```

```
 Nouns that end in y are formed two ways.
```

1. When letter before **y** is a vowel, add **s.**
valley valleys
key keys
boy boys
day days
2. Nouns ending with a consonant and y are formed by changing the **y** to an **i**
and adding **es.**
city cities
grocery groceries
library libraries
blueberry blueberries

```
 Nouns that end in o are formed two ways.
```

1. When the letter before the **o** is a vowel, add s. Musical terms ending in **o** are
formed by adding an **s**.
kilo kilos
tempo tempos
cello cellos

2. When the letter before the **o** is a consonant, no standard rule applies. It is
helpful to memorize the plural forms of words you use regularly. If you are
unsure, you should always check a current dictionary.
potato potatoes
logo logos

```
 Nouns that end in f or fe do not follow any standard rules. It is helpful to
memorize the plural forms of the words you use regularly and check a dictionary
if you are unsure.
life lives
calf calves
leaf leaves
belief beliefs
```

```
 Irregular nouns become plural by changing their spelling. Check a dictionary if
you are unsure of the plural form. It is helpful to memorize the plural form of the
most common irregular nouns.
foot feet
child children
man men
tooth teeth
```

```
 Some nouns do not change when they become plural. These nouns have the
same spelling when they are singular and plural.
sheep
trout
salmon
moose
```

```
When dictionaries show two different forms of the plural noun, the preferred
form is shown first.
```

**Family names and other proper nouns**

When _the_ appears before the last name, the last name is always plural. For example,
_the Johnsons will vacation in California this year_. Holiday cards often show how many
people do not understand this rule. The exception to this rule is if the family name is
followed by the word _family_. The word _family_ makes the proper noun plural. For
example, _Johnson_ is singular, but _the Johnson famil_y is plural.

**Proper nouns become plural by adding an s or es to the ending**. If the proper noun
ends in s, x, z, ch, or sh, then the plural is formed by adding _es_.

```
Lopez Lopezes The Lopezes The Lopez family
Woods Woodses The Woodses The Woods family
Ontario Ontarios The Ontarios The Ontario family
```

**All other proper nouns become plural by adding s**.

```
October Octobers
Smith Smiths
Pepsi Pepsis
Disneyland Disneylands
```

**Compound nouns**

Compound nouns are two or more words that are combined to form a single noun.
_Editor-in-chief_ and _vice president_ are both compound nouns. Sometimes compound
nouns contain hyphens, but most do not.

_Sister-in-law_ is a compound noun. I have more than one sister-in-law, so how do we
make that plural? The key is to figure out which part of the compound noun is the main
noun. The _law_ part of the compound describes what kind of sister. The main noun is
_sister_. The correct plural form is _sisters-in-law._

```
brother-in-law brothers-in-law
editor-in-chief editors-in-chief
vice president vice presidents
```

If the compound noun does not have a main noun, then the final part of the compound
noun is made plural.

```
start-up start-ups
eight-year-old eight-year-olds
```

Some compound nouns have two acceptable plural forms. In the dictionary, the
preferred spelling is shown first, but both are considered acceptable.

```
attorney general attorneys general or attorney generals
teaspoonful teaspoonfuls or teaspoonsful
```

**Abbreviations, degrees, numerals, and alphabet letters**

Numerals, academic degrees, abbreviations, and capital alphabet letters (except A, I,
M, and U) become plural by adding a lowercase _s._

```
12s 1990s
MBAs all Bs and Cs
```

All lowercase letters and the capital letters A, I, M, and U are made plural by adding an
apostrophe and _s_. The apostrophe is added for clarity. This is the only time that a plural
is formed by adding an apostrophe and s. If you did not add the apostrophe, the words
might be confused as the words _us, as_, and _is_.

```
dot your i‟s all A‟s and Bs
M‟s U‟s
```

Abbreviations for units of measurement often have identical singular and plural forms.

```
oz. ounce or ounces
ft. foot or feet
km kilometer or kilometers
```

Some measurements have more than one plural form. In addition, the measurement
abbreviations are acceptable with or without periods. The important thing is to remain
consistent with your measurement throughout your document. Do not switch between
two plural forms of the abbreviation. That causes confusion. Pick one and use it
consistently in your document.

```
lb. or lbs. (without periods is also acceptable) pounds
qt. or qts. (without periods is also acceptable quarts
yd. or yds. (without periods is also acceptable) yards
```

#### Possessive Nouns

Possessive nouns show ownership, origin, or time. To make a noun possessive, you
add an apostrophe and _s_.

```
 Fred‟s motorcycle (ownership)
 Hawaii‟s weather (origin)
 five years‟ time (time)
```

Writers can also show possession by using a prepositional phrase instead of a
possessive noun.

```
 The motorcycle belonging to Fred
 The weather of Hawaii
 The time of five years
```

Both options are grammatically correct. It is important to know how to form a possessive
noun both ways. In most cases, it is more efficient to use the possessive noun.
Some sentences require knowledge of both tricks for forming the possessive. **Back-to-**
**back possessive nouns** can create awkward and confusing sentences. They are
grammatically correct, but they sound awkward. To avoid confusing sentences, rewrite
one of the possessives as a prepositional phrase.

```
 My sister‟s boss‟s recommendation (awkward and wordy)
 The recommendation of my sister‟s boss (improved)
```

If it sounds awkward and confusing, rewrite the sentence.

#### Using the Apostrophe

Apostrophes have two purposes: to show possession and to show missing letters in a
contraction. Apostrophes never make nouns plural. How do you know where to use an
apostrophe?

1. Look for possessive words
Usually the nouns appear together in a sentence, and the first noun shows ownership.

```
 Mary‟s shoes
 the instructor‟s notes
 Hawaii‟s beaches
```

2. Reverse the nouns
If you are not sure if the nouns are possessive, try reversing the nouns. Use the second
noun to make a prepositional phrase.

```
 The shoes belonging to Mary
 The notes of the instructor
 The beaches of Hawaii
```

3. Determine if the noun is singular or plural
People often get confused about where to put the apostrophe. It depends on two things:
whether the noun is singular or plural and if the noun ends in s.

```
Singular possessive noun Plural possessive noun
```

```
Noun does not Add an apostrophe and s Add an apostrophe and s
```

```
end in s student‟s assignments
```

```
woman's shoes women's shoes
```

```
child's toy children's toy
```

```
Ends in s Add an apostrophe and s Add an apostrophe only
```

```
students‟ assignments
```

```
actress's costume actresses' costumes
```

```
witness's testimony witnesses' testimony
```

**TIP:** When making plural, possessive nouns, it is helpful to make the noun plural first.
Once the noun is plural, then you can determine how to make it possessive.

**Do not confuse possessive nouns with contractions.** A contraction is a shortened
form of one or two words. An apostrophe is used in place of the missing letters. _Cannot_
becomes _can’t_. _Do not_ becomes _don’t._ The most confusing one of all is _it’s_. _It’s_ is a
contraction of the words _it is_ or _it has_. _It’s_ is not possessive, it is a contraction. _Its_ is a
possessive pronoun. _It’s_ is a contraction.

#### Challenges with Possessive Nouns

**Descriptive nouns** describe the noun, but they do not show ownership. Do not use
an apostrophe. The key is to look for ownership. If the noun is only describing, and not
showing ownership, then no apostrophe is needed. For example, _Human Resources_
_Department_ is a descriptive noun. _Human Resources_ does not own the department, but
it is describing the type of department.

```
 United States Army (not United States‟ Army)
 Sales Department (not Sales‟ Department)
```

**Compound nouns** become possessive by adding an apostrophe or an apostrophe
_s_ to the end of the compound word.

```
 Mother-in-law‟s (singular and possessive)
 Sisters-in-law‟s (plural and possessive)
 Start-ups‟ (plural and possessive)
```

**Family names** become possessive by following the same rules as other nouns.
Singular names form their possessive by adding an apostrophe and _s_. Plural names
already end in _s_. Add an apostrophe to make the plural name possessive.

```
Singular Name Singular Possessive Plural Possessive
```

```
Mr. Jones Mr. Jones's house the Joneses' house
```

```
Mrs. Johnson Mrs. Johnson's yacht the Johnsons' vacation
```

This rule is broken a lot. Holiday cards are often signed, “_Happy Holidays from the_
_Smith’s!_” It is incorrect. Apostrophes make nouns possessive, not plural.

**Abbreviations** become possessive by following the same rules as other nouns. If
the abbreviation is singular, then you add an apostrophe and _s_. If the abbreviation is
plural and ends in _s_, then you only add the apostrophe.

```
 NBC‟s Olympic coverage (singular, does not end in s)
 Both CEOs‟ signatures were required (plural and ends in s)
 CBS‟s fall schedule (singular and ends in s)
```

**Company and organization names** that include possessives may not use
correct grammar. It is important to use the company‟s legal name, even if it uses
incorrect grammar. Consult the company‟s website for their preferred spelling.

```
 Starbucks Coffee
 McDonald‟s
 Macy‟s (uses a star in place of the apostrophe)
```

**Time and money** can show possession, and they need to be punctuated properly.

```
 one year‟s experience (the experience of one year)
 five years‟ experience (the experience of five years)
 one dollar‟s worth (the worth of one dollar)
 twenty dollars‟ worth (the worth of twenty dollars)
 today‟s class (the class of today)
```

If the possessive construction seems awkward, then it is perfectly acceptable to use the
prepositional phrase instead. Both options are grammatically correct.

**Incomplete possessives** happen when the second noun in the possessive
construction is implied and not stated. If you choose to leave off the second noun, make
sure that the reader knows what word you implied. When in doubt, don‟t leave the word
off.

```
 The family will meet at Mary‟s for the party. (Mary‟s house is implied.)
 This year‟s price is better than last year‟s. (Last year‟s price is implied.)
```

**Compound possession** happens when two nouns own something together or
separately. It can confuse the best of us. If two or more nouns share ownership, then
you only need one apostrophe and _s_.
 Mary and Fred‟s dog is white. (combined ownership)
 Sarah and Theresa‟s house has a pool. (combined ownership)
If two or more nouns have separate ownership, then both nouns need to be possessive.

```
 Mary‟s and Fred‟s suitcases were lost. (Separate ownership. They both lost their
suitcases.)
 Sarah‟s and Theresa‟s cats are striped. (Separate ownership. Sarah and
Theresa each own a striped cat.)
```

**Academic degrees** should be written as possessives. These degrees are not
capitalized unless they are used as an abbreviation.

```
 A bachelor‟s degree is required for the position.
 Mary earned a master‟s degree in biology.
 He has a bachelor‟s and a master‟s. (possessive form is required even if the
word degree is implied)
```

**Apostrophes make nouns possessive, not plural.**
Do not rely on computer software to catch errors with plural and possessive nouns. The
placement of the apostrophe can change the meaning of the sentence. The following
two sentences are both grammatically correct, but they have different meanings.

```
 The student‟s cupcake smelled delicious. (One student with one cupcake)
 The students‟ cupcake smelled delicious. (More than one student sharing one
cupcake.)
```

```
 The teacher began class by calling the students names. (Very rude!)
 The teacher began class by calling the students‟ names. (Much better!)
```

**Chapter 4**

## Pronouns

Pronouns take the place of a noun in a sentence. This makes writing and speaking
much more efficient.

```
 Fred asked Mary if Mary could pick Fred up at Fred’s office. (Without
pronouns)
 Fred asked Mary if she could pick him up at his office. (Pronouns are
underlined.)
```

The first sentence is grammatically correct, but it is very inefficient. It‟s also a bit
confusing and boring. The noun that a pronoun is referring to is called the **antecedent**.

```
 Fred bought flowers and he gave them to Mary.
```

The pronoun _he_ refers to the antecedent _Fred_. The pronoun _them_ refers to the
antecedent _flowers_. If you are using a pronoun, it is important that the antecedent is
clear.

#### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns can be sorted into three different cases: subjective case, objective
case, and possessive case. Most pronouns have a different form depending on who is
speaking or being spoken to.

```
Subjective
Case
Sing. Plural
```

```
Objective
Case
Sing. Plural
```

```
Possessive
Case
Sing. Plural
```

**First Person**
(person speaking)

```
I we me us my our
mine ours
```

**Second Person**
(person is speaking to you)

```
you you you you your your
yours yours
```

**Third Person**
(person or thing spoken of)

```
he they
she
it
```

```
him them
her
it
```

```
his, her theirs
hers, its theirs
```

**Subjective case pronouns** perform the action of the verb. Verbs show the action
of the sentence, and the subject shows who or what is performing that action. If the
subject is a pronoun, then the pronoun must be in the subjective case. Only subjective
case pronouns can work as the subjects of verbs. If a pronoun appears as the subject of
a sentence, then it must be in the subjective case.

```
 I am going to Hawaii. (First person subjective case pronoun)
 You need to study for the test. (Second person subjective case)
 They work well together. (Third person subjective case)
```

Subjective case pronouns also follow all forms of the verb _be_ (am, is, are, was, were,
be, been). This can be confusing, and it might initially sound strange because objective
case pronouns usually follow verbs.

```
 This is she. (not her)
 It was they. (not them)
```

It can sound a bit unnatural and stuffy, but it is grammatically correct. If it sounds too
stuffy for your style, then rewrite your sentence. Often rewriting involves taking the
pronoun out and using the antecedent instead.

```
 This is Sarah. (Instead of she)
 It was Mary, Fred, and Dan. (Instead of they)
```

**Objective case pronouns** work as the object of a verb. A direct object shows who
or what receives the action of the verb. The direct object is not performing the action,

but is receiving the action. If the direct object is a pronoun, then it must be in the
objective case.

```
 The boss gave me a day off. (The boss performed the action of the verb.)
 Mary likes you. (Mary performed the action of the verb.)
 Fred drove them to the park. (Fred performed the action of the verb.)
 Sarah carried it to the park. (Sarah performed the action of the verb.)
```

In all of the examples, the objective case pronoun is not performing the action of the
verb. It is just hanging out and receiving the action of the verb.

**Objective case pronouns** also work as the **object of a preposition**. Prepositions
describe a relationship in time or space and answer the questions where and when.
_Between, at, from, under, over_, and _above_ are all prepositions. Prepositions always act
as part of a prepositional phrase. The object of the preposition is a noun or pronoun. If
it is a pronoun, then the pronoun is always in the objective case. This can get tricky with
prepositions such as _between, except,_ and _like_. The trick is to isolate the prepositional
phrase. If any pronouns are objects of the preposition, then they need to be in the
objective case.

```
 Fred threw the ball to him. (Object of the preposition to)
 Keep the secret between you and me. (Object of the preposition between)
 Everyone except Mary and him saw the movie. (Object of the preposition except)
```

This rule gets mixed up a lot, and it might take a while to train your brain to use this rule
correctly. The biggest mistake is saying “between you and I.” The correct way to say it is
“between you and me.” _Me_ might sound casual or non-academic, but it is just as formal
and academic as saying _I._ It is also correct.

Popular music doesn‟t help the case. Jessica Simpson, Every Avenue, and over twenty
other artists on iTunes have songs titled “Between You and I.” One group is even called
“Between You and I.” It is incorrect. The songs might be catchy, but do not rely on
popular music to teach correct grammar.

If you have trouble deciding whether to use a subjective or objective pronoun, it is
helpful to find the verb. If the pronoun is the one performing the action of the verb, then
it needs to be in the subjective case. If the pronoun is receiving the action of the verb,
then the pronoun needs to be in the objective case. If the pronoun follows a preposition,
then it is the object of the preposition and needs to be in the objective form. Subjective
pronouns insist on performing the action of a verb, and objective pronouns prefer to sit
back and let the action come to them.

**Possessive case pronouns** show ownership. Possessive pronouns do not have
apostrophes like possessive nouns.

```
 Is this mine? (First person possessive case)
 The shoes by the door must be yours. (Second person possessive case)
 The tickets are theirs. (Third person possessive case)
```

When possessive pronouns describe nouns, they are acting as adjectives. Her car, his
motorcycle, their vacation, your assignment, are all examples of possessive pronouns
acting as adjectives. This will be covered more in Chapter 7.

Don‟t confuse possessive pronouns with contractions. Contractions are words or
phrases that have been shortened by removing letters. An apostrophe is added to the
contraction in place of the missing letters. _Will not_ becomes _won’t_. _Cannot_ becomes
_can’t. They are_ becomes _they’re_. The biggest mistake is with the word _its_. _Its_ is a
possessive pronoun. It shows ownership. _It’s_ is a contraction, and is short for the words
“it is” or “it has.” If you cannot decide whether you should use “its” or “it‟s” in a sentence,
just replace the word with the words “it is” or “it has.” If the sentence still makes sense,
then use the contraction “it‟s.” If the sentence no longer makes sense, then “its” is the
correct choice.

#### Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement

Pronouns take the place of a noun in a sentence, so it is important to make sure it is
clear which noun the pronoun is replacing. When the pronoun does not match with the
noun it is replacing, the sentence is very confusing. Using pronouns correctly means
following these rules:

1. **The pronoun must have a clear antecedent.** If the reader can‟t figure out what the
pronoun is referring to, then the sentence is too vague.

```
 It was on the table. (What is it?)
 Mary told Sarah that she was in trouble. (Who is in trouble?)
```

2. **Pronouns must have the same number (singular or plural) as the antecedent.** If
a pronoun is replacing a plural noun, then the pronoun also needs to be plural. Singular
pronouns replace singular nouns.

```
 Sarah forgot that she was scheduled to work on Saturday. (Singular
antecedent, singular pronoun)
 The students set their books down. (Plural antecedent, plural pronoun)
 Mary, Sarah, and Fred drove to their favorite restaurant. (Plural antecedent,
plural pronoun)
```

3. **Pronouns must have the same gender (masculine, feminine, or neutral) as the**
**antecedent**. A masculine pronoun replaces a masculine noun. A feminine pronoun
replaces a feminine noun. It is important that the pronoun agrees with the antecedent.

```
 Mary ordered her favorite meal. (Feminine antecedent, feminine pronoun)
 The soup had a fly in it. (Neutral antecedent, neutral pronoun)
```

The English language is lacking a singular, third-person, gender-neutral pronoun. This
is fine when referring to something such as soup, but it creates a problem when
referring to people that could be male or female.

```
 Every student must submit (his, her, its, his or her) assignment by Tuesday.
```

Which pronoun is correct? There isn‟t a perfect answer here. _Its_ sounds like the student
is not human. In the past, writers were instructed to choose the masculine pronoun in
these situations. This kind of writing sounds antiquated and sexist today. Writers can
choose to use _his and her_ in a sentence. This is an acceptable way around the pronoun
problem, but it can sound awkward and wordy if it is used too often.

Another solution is to rewrite the sentence entirely. This option is used the most.
Luckily, there is a plural, gender-neutral, third-person pronoun. _They, them, their,_ and
_theirs_ form the team to fix this problem, but the writer must make the antecedent plural
too.

```
 Students must submit their assignments by Tuesday. (Plural antecedent, plural
pronoun)
```

In casual conversation, many people use _they_ as a singular, gender neutral, third-
person pronoun. _They_ is a plural pronoun, not a singular pronoun, so it is not correct to
use this in formal documents. English is always evolving, so eventually _they_ might fill
the void that is missing on Team Pronoun. For now, treat _they_ as a plural pronoun only.

#### Pronoun Challenges

**Compound Subjects and Objects**
Pronouns cause problems when they appear in combination with other nouns.

```
 I like coffee. (Correct. I is a subjective pronoun.)
 My brother and I like coffee. (Even though another noun showed up in the
sentence, the pronoun remains the same.)
 My brother and me like coffee. (Wrong. Me is an objective pronoun, and it has no
business acting as part of the subject.)
```

The trick to choosing the correct pronoun for the sentence is to ignore the other noun
and the conjunction (usually and). You can cover it with your hand if that is helpful.

```
 Fred and she went to the beach. Ignore “Fred and” to select the correct
subjective case pronoun.)
 Sarah asked the boss and him for advice. (Ignore “the boss and” to select the
correct objective case pronoun.)
 Would you like Mary or her to drive tonight? (Ignore “Mary or” to select the
correct objective case pronoun.)
 My brother and I like coffee. (Ignore “My brother and” to select the correct
subjective case pronoun.)
```

**Reflexive Pronouns**
Reflexive pronouns end in -self or -selves and _reflect_ back to their antecedents in the
same sentence. Think of them as vain pronouns that need a mirror to reflect their
image. Reflexive pronouns are reflecting off of the antecedent in the same sentence.
_Myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves,_ and _themselves_ are all
examples of reflexive pronouns. The big challenge with reflexive pronouns is to make
sure that the antecedent is in the same sentence. A reflexive pronoun cannot show up
in a sentence without an antecedent.

```
 The students wanted to see themselves in the picture. (Themselves reflects on
the students.)
 Mary looked at herself in the mirror. (Herself reflects on Mary.)
 I am going to treat myself to a scone. (Myself reflects on I.)
```

Problems show up when people use a reflexive pronoun instead of a personal pronoun.
Some people feel uncomfortable using _me_ in a sentence, so they choose _myself_
instead. One is not more formal or more intellectual than the other, but _me_ and _myself_
follow different rules so they are not interchangeable. Reflexive pronouns must have an
antecedent in the sentence to reflect on. If it does not, then use a personal pronoun
instead.

```
 Please email Fred or myself with any questions. (WRONG! The reflexive pronoun
has nothing to reflect on in the sentence.)
 Please email Fred or me with questions. (Correct.)
```

**Subject Complements**
Subjective case pronouns (_I, you, he, she, they, it_) follow linking verbs. Linking verbs
are all forms of the verb _be_, including _am, is, are, was, were, be, been_, and _has been_.
Normally, objective case pronouns follow verbs, so this rule can sound awkward and
stiff at first.

```
 It is I.
 That was he.
 Was it she who called earlier?
```

If it sounds too stiff, you can rewrite the sentence to sound more natural. _It is I_ becomes
_I am here._ Another rewriting option is to not use a pronoun at all, and switch the
pronoun back to a noun. _That was he_ becomes _That was Fred_. _Was it she who called_
_earlier_ becomes _Was it Sarah who called earlier?_

**Indefinite Pronouns**
Indefinite pronouns, such as _everybody, anyone,_ and _everything_, are called indefinite
because they are not referring to anyone specific. Indefinite pronouns are rather vague
about whom they represent. Words such as _everybody_ and _everything_ sound like a
large number, but these indefinite pronouns are treated as singular pronouns. Some
indefinite pronouns are always singular and some are always plural.
**Always Singular Always Plural**
anybody neither both
anyone nobody few
anything no one many
each nothing others
either somebody several
everybody someone
everyone something
everything

Indefinite pronouns can work as antecedents for other pronouns in the sentence. Make
sure that the pronoun agrees with the antecedent. If the indefinite pronoun antecedent
is plural, then the pronoun must be plural too.

```
 Everyone on the women‟s basketball team did her best. (The antecedent
Everyone is feminine and singular.)
 Many Starbucks locations give their used coffee grounds to gardeners. (The
antecedent Many is plural.)
 Each email address has its own unique password. (The antecedent Each is
singular and neutral.)
```

**Collective Nouns**
Collective nouns such as _team, faculty, flock, union_, and _committee_ refer to a group.
When talking about the group as a unit, they are considered singular. If the collective
noun is not working as a singular unit, then it is plural.

If you cannot figure out if the collective noun is plural or singular, ask yourself if it is
acting as a unit. Collective nouns act like a bag of candy. A bag of candy is a singular

unit. It is contained and all of the candy is traveling as a unit. What if the bag rips open?
The candies in the bag are no longer working as a singular unit; instead, they are
moving in all different directions. The bag of candy is singular, but the candies are
plural. Is the antecedent acting like the bag of candy, or is it acting like the spilled
candies?

```
 The team accepted its trophy. (Team is working as one unit.)
 The jury handed down its verdict. (Jury is working as one unit.)
 The jury could not agree on their verdict. (Jury is not working as one unit.)
```

It can sound awkward to use a singular pronoun with a noun that sounds plural. In those
cases, rewrite your sentence by adding a plural noun as the antecedent.

 The team members accepted their trophy. (Antecedent is members.)
 The jury members handed down their verdict. (Antecedent is members.)
**Who vs Whom**
Who vs whom poses a challenge to many people today. _Who_ is a subjective case
pronoun and works as the subject of a verb.

```
 Who called? (Who is the subject of the verb)
 Who is going to the conference? (Who is the subject of the verb)
```

Who also follows linking verbs and acts as the subject complement.

```
 His manager is who? (Who follows the linking verb is)
```

_Whom_ is an objective case pronoun, and acts as the object of the verb or the object of
the preposition. _Whom_ is not performing the action of the verb. _Whom_ can either receive
the action of the verb or be the object of the preposition.

```
 To whom it may concern: (Whom follows the preposition to)
 Fred works for whom? (Whom follows the preposition for)
 Mary drives whom to school? (Whom is the object of the verb drives)
```

_Who_ is used as a subjective case pronoun, and _whom_ is used as an objective case
pronoun. Still not 100 percent clear? There are a few tricks to make this easier.

1. **If who/whom follows a preposition, then the choice is always whom. To whom,**
**at whom, for whom, from whom.**
2. **Mentally replace the word who/whom in your sentence with he or him.** If your
sentence makes sense switching the word to _he_, then _who_ is the correct choice. Both
_he_ and _who_ are subjective case pronouns, so they work the same way. If your sentence

makes sense switching the word to _him_, then _whom_ is the correct choice. Both _him_ and
_whom_ are objective case pronouns, and they follow the same rules. It is easy to
remember that _him_ and _whom_ go together because they both end with the letter _m_.

```
 Who/whom brought the doughnuts?
 He brought the doughnuts. (Correct! This makes sense.)
 Him brought the doughnuts. (Incorrect. This does not make sense.)
 The correct choice is: Who brought the doughnuts?
```

This trick doesn‟t work for every sentence. If it doesn‟t work for your sentence, the next
trick will work.

3. _Who/Whom_ phrases are often questions. One trick to discovering whether to use _who_
or _whom_ is to just answer the question. If the answer could be _he_, then _who_ is the
correct choice for your sentence. If the answer could be _him_, then _whom_ is the correct
choice. If the sentence is not a question, you can isolate the _who/whom_ phrase and
read it as a question.

```
 Who/Whom should I thank for this free coffee? (Answer the question.)
I should thank he. (Wrong.)
I should thank him. (Correct!)
Who = he
Whom = him
Whom should I thank for this free coffee? (Correct!)
```

```
 Who/whom is coming to the concert?
He is coming to the concert. (Correct!)
Him is coming to the concert. (Wrong.)
Who = he
Whom = him
Who is coming to the concert? (Correct!)
```

```
 I do not care who/whom she took to the dance. (This is not a question, so isolate
the who/whom phrase and read it as a question.)
Who/whom did she take to the dance? (The who/whom phrase is isolated as a
question.)
She took him to the dance. (Correct!)
She took he to the dance. (Wrong.)
I do not care whom she took to the dance. (Correct!)
```

Academy of Learning Video on who/whom:

**Whose**
_Whose_ is a possessive pronoun. It is the possessive form of the pronoun _who_. _Whose_
can refer to people or things. Do not confuse _whose_ with the contraction _who’s_. _Who’s_ is
a contraction of words _who is_ or _who has_.

```
 Whose shoes are these? (possessive pronoun)
 We cannot decide whose assignment was the best. (possessive pronoun)
 Do you know who‟s coming to the conference? (contraction)
 Who‟s responded to the invitation? (contraction)
```

## Verbs

Verbs show the action or the state of being in a sentence. Imagine these sentences
without verbs. They do not make sense without verbs.

```
 Fred cooks dinner every night. (Action)
 Dan is the new manager. (State of being)
 Sarah flew to Hawaii. (Action)
```

#### Types of Verbs

Verbs can be sorted into three different categories: action verbs, linking verbs, and
helping verbs.

**Action verbs** show the action in a sentence. _Cook, drive, run, spin, jump, fly,_ and
_twirl_ are all action verbs. Action verbs can be sorted even more. Action verbs are either
transitive or intransitive.

A **transitive verb** transfers its action onto a direct object. It helps that both transitive
and transfer begin with trans-.

```
 Fred made soup. (Made is a transitive verb. It transfers the action made to the
soup.)
 Fred made. (Incorrect. Made is a transitive verb and needs a direct object in
order for the sentence to make sense. This sentence does not make any sense.)
```

An **intransitive verb** does not have a direct object. Intransitive verbs do not need direct
objects in order for the sentence to make sense.

```
 Mary ran. (Ran is an intransitive verb. It does not need a direct object to
complete the meaning of the sentence.)
 Sarah stood. (Stood is an intransitive verb. It does not need a direct object to
complete the meaning of the sentence.)
```

Most verbs are both transitive and intransitive. It just depends on how the verb is being
used in a sentence.

```
 Mary drove. (Intransitive)
 Mary drove the car. (Transitive. Car is the direct object and is receiving the action
of the verb drove.)
```

There is a quick way to figure out if a verb is transitive or intransitive. Immediately after
the verb, ask the question _whom?_ or _what?_ If you can answer the question with
information in the sentence, then that is the direct object. Transitive verbs have direct
objects.

```
 Dan flew the airplane. (Dan flew what? Dan flew the airplane. Airplane is the
direct object. Flew is a transitive verb.)
 Fred drove the kids to school. (Fred drove whom? Fred drove the kids. Kids acts
as the direct object for the transitive verb drove.)
```

Verbs)

#### Linking Verbs

Linking verbs describe a state of being. They link the subject to more information about
the subject. All forms of the verb _be_ are linking verbs (_is, am, are, was, were,_ and _has_
_been_). Linking verbs connect subjects to their complements. A complement completes
the meaning of the subject.

```
 Mary is the boss. (The linking verb is links Mary to the complement, boss.)
 The bird is red. (The linking verb is links bird to the complement, red.)
 The car was dirty. (The linking verb was links car to the complement, dirty.)
```

Some sensing verbs act as both linking verbs and action verbs. _Feels, appears, tastes,_
_seems, sounds, looks_, and _smells_ are all verbs that describe the senses. Sometimes

these verbs play on the linking verb team, and other times they play on the action verb
team. How can you tell which team they are playing on? There is a quick trick. If you
can replace the sensing verb with a variation of the verb _be_, and the sentence still
makes sense, then the verb is a linking verb.

```
 The cat smells bad. Is that an action verb or a linking verb? Replace the verb
with a variation of the verb be. The cat is bad. That still makes sense. Smells is
working as a linking verb. The meaning of the sentence: the cat stinks.
 The cat smells badly. Is that an action verb or a linking verb? Replace the verb
with a variation of the verb be. The cat is badly. That doesn‟t make any sense.
Smells is an action verb. The meaning of the sentence: the cat has trouble
smelling things.
 She felt happy. Action verb or linking verb? She is happy. That makes sense. In
this case, felt is a linking verb.
 She felt the wind in her hair. Action verb or linking verb? She is the wind in her
hair. No, that doesn‟t make any sense. Felt is an action verb in this case.
```

#### Helping Verbs

Helping verbs show up in sentences to help out other verbs. Helping verbs never show
up on their own. Instead, they help other verbs (linking and action) form verb phrases.
The main helping verbs are all variations of the verb _be_. If a variation of the verb _be_
appears in the sentence on its own, then it is always a linking verb. If it shows up as part
of a verb phrase, then it is a helping verb. There are 23 helping verbs: _am, is, are, was,_
_were, be, been, being, has, have, had, do, does, did, may, must, might, can, could,_
_shall, should, will,_ and _would_.

```
 Fred is cooking dinner. (Is is the helping verb. Cooking is the main verb. Is
cooking is a verb phrase.)
 Mary can show you the report. (Can is the helping verb. Show is the main verb.
Can show is a verb phrase.)
```

#### Active Voice and Passive Voice

Transitive verbs can be sorted even further into active voice and passive voice. In
**active voice**, the subject is performing the action in the sentence. It is very direct.
Active voice is very clear, strong, and effective.

```
 Fred cooked dinner. (Fred is performing the action of the verb.)
 Mary ran the race. (Mary is performing the action of the verb.)
 Dan sent an email to Sarah. (Dan is performing the action of the verb.)
```

In **passive voice** the direct object of the verb becomes the subject of the sentence. The
subject of the sentence is not performing the action of the verb in passive sentences.
Often these sentences omit who is performing the action of the sentence. These
sentences are vague about who performed the action of the sentence. Politicians often

use passive voice to avoid assigning blame. Because these sentences are vague about
who is performing the action in the sentence, the focus of the sentence becomes the
direct object.

```
 The dinner was cooked. (Who cooked the dinner?)
 The race was run. (Who ran the race?)
 An email was sent to Sarah. (Who sent the email to Sarah?)
```

Active voice is usually shorter, clearer, and more direct than passive voice. In most
cases, active voice is the preferred way to get your point across. Passive voice can
sound wordy, awkward, and weaker than active voice. There are some instances when
passive voice is preferred. News reporters often speak in passive voice when they do
not know who performed the action. For example, “Cars were stolen.” Who stole the
cars? If you do not know, then passive voice is an appropriate choice.

## Verb Tenses

Verbs do more than just show the action. Verbs reveal four additional things: 1. the
number of subjects performing the action (singular or plural); 2. the person speaking
(first, second, third); 3. the voice (active or passive); and 4. when the action happened.
Verbs have a lot of work to do in a sentence!

**Present tense** verbs show action that is currently happening or a habitual action.

```
 Fred and Mary walk five miles every evening. (habitual action)
 Mary drives the car to work. (habitual action)
```

**Past tense** verbs show action that happened in the past. Regular verbs form the past
tense by adding -ed or -d.

```
 Sarah traveled to Hawaii. (Event happened in the past)
 Dan worked on the report. (Event happened in the past)
```

**Future tense** verbs show action that will happen in the future. The helping verb _will_ is
added to the principal verb to form the future tense. _Shall_ is another helping verb that
can be used to form the future tense, but it is not as common.

```
 Dave will travel to Las Vegas next week. (Event will happen in the future)
 You will receive an invitation in the mail. (Event will happen in the future)
```

```

```

```

Note that third-person singular verbs are different than all of the other present tense
verbs. Third-person singular verbs require an -s ending. Add -es if the verb ends in s,
sh, ch, x, or z.

```
 Fred cooks (not cook) dinner every night.
 Stephanie teaches (not teach) many subjects.
 Mary drives (not drive) the kids to school.
```

#### Participles What are participles? Participles are another form that a verb takes.

Every verb has five forms: present, past, present participle, past participle, and infinitive.
Participles come in two varieties, present and past, and they are used in three different
ways.

**Present participles** are formed by adding -ing to the present tense of a verb. This is
the case for all regular verbs and all irregular verbs. Present participles always end in -
ing. This is always the case, and there are no exceptions.

**Present tense Present participle**

run running

swim swimming

cook cooking

dance dancing

**Past participles** of regular verbs are formed by adding -d or -ed to the present tense of
a verb. Unfortunately, irregular verbs do not follow any established rule. Be sure to look
them up in a dictionary. A dictionary will list the past participle form of the verb.

**Present tense Past participle**

walk walked

blend blended

drive driven

feel felt

Why are participles important? Participles are important to learn because they are used
three different ways.

1. **Participles combine with helping verbs to form verb phrases.** Neither present
participles nor past participles can act as a verb in a sentence without helping verbs.
Helping verbs are required for a participle to work as a verb.

```
 Fred is cooking dinner tonight. (Is is the helping verb. Cooking is the present
participle of the verb cook.)
 Dave was planning to attend the concert. (Was is the helping verb. Planning is
the present participle of the verb plan.)
 Mary had blended the milkshake perfectly. (Had is the helping verb. Blended is
the past participle of the verb blend.)
 Sarah had studied all night. (Had is the helping verb. Studied is the past
participle of the verb study.)
```

2. **Present and past participles can also work as adjectives.** Adjectives describe
nouns or pronouns.
 Sarah enjoyed her swimming lessons. (The present participle swimming is
describing the lessons.)
 The dripping faucet kept them awake. (The present participle dripping is
describing the faucet.)
 The **wrecked** car was towed to the repair shop. (The past participle _wrecked_ is
describing the car.)
 The **broken** window was repaired quickly. (The past participle _broken_ is
describing the window.)

3. Present participles can also work as nouns. When present participles are acting as a
noun, they are called **gerunds**. A gerund might look like a verb, but it is acting like a
noun. Gerunds always end in -ing.

```
 Running is great exercise. (Running is the present participle of the verb run and
is acting as a gerund in this sentence.)
 Skiing is a winter sport. (Skiing is the present participle of the verb ski and is
acting as a gerund.)
 Dave enjoys traveling to new places. (Traveling is the present participle of the
verb travel and is acting as a gerund. Traveling is the direct object of the verb
enjoys.)
```

**If a pronoun is modifying a gerund, then it must be in the possessive form.** There
are a few exceptions, but it changes the meaning of the sentence. In most cases, the
possessive form is needed.

```
 She was bothered by his texting during class. (Not him. Texting is a gerund and
requires the possessive pronoun his.)
 We objected to your buying the expensive tickets for us. (Not you. We did not
object to you, but to the action of your buying the tickets. Buying is a gerund and
requires the possessive pronoun your.)
```

Remember that past and present participles cannot act as a verb without helping verbs.
If a participle is hanging out in your sentence without helping verbs, it is either acting as
an adjective or as a noun (gerund).

[http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/participle.htm](http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/participle.htm)

#### Infinitives

An infinitive is the word _to_ plus the present form of a verb: _to swim, to run, to catch, to_
_drive, to learn_. Infinitives can be used as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

```
 Sarah refused to eat the brussel sprouts. (To eat is the infinitive and is acting as
a noun. It is the direct object of the verb refused.)
 Fred raced home to watch the football game. (To watch is the infinitive and is
acting as an adverb. It is modifying the verb raced.)
```

A common error with infinitives happens when people change “to” to the conjunction
“and.”

```
 Be sure to call when you arrive. (Not be sure and call when you arrive.)
```

```
 Try to arrive on time. (Not try and arrive on time.)
```

An infinitive is both words: _to_ plus the present form of the verb. It was once considered a
grammatical crime to add any other words between _to_ and the verb. This is called a split
infinitive. In Latin, infinitives are only one word, so they cannot be split. Two words form
an infinitive in English, but the Latin rule transitioned over to English. The most famous
split infinitive is from Star Trek: “To _boldly_ go where no one has gone before.” Not only
did they split the infinitive, but they split it with the word _boldly_. Fixing the split infinitive
does not sound as catchy, “To go boldly where no one has gone before.” It loses its
impact. Split infinitives are considered acceptable today if they are necessary for clarity
or effect. Be aware that splitting infinitives can lead to awkward sentences.

```
 She decided to, on her way home from work, call her sister. (awkward)
 On her way home from work, she decided to call her sister. (better)
```

#### Participle Phrases

Participles and gerunds are often used to form phrases; these are called participle
phrases. When a participle phrase introduces a sentence, it modifies the subject of the
sentence. These phrases are separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.
Sentences can be confusing, and sometimes comical, when the introductory participle
phrase does not modify the intended subject.

```
 (Illogical) Flying in the airplane, the mountains looked beautiful. (The
introductory phrase modifies the first noun it comes to: mountains. This sentence
means that the mountains were flying in an airplane and looking beautiful.)
 (Correct) Flying in the airplane, Dave looked at the beautiful mountains.
(The introductory phrase is modifying Dave. This sentence means that Dave is
flying in an airplane and looking at the beautiful mountains.)
 (Illogical) Standing in line at Starbucks, the cell phone rang. (The
introductory phrase is modifying the cell phone. The sentence means that the cell
phone is standing in line at Starbucks.)
 (Correct) Standing in line at Starbucks, Mary heard her cell phone ring. (The
introductory phrase is modifying Mary. This sentence means that Mary is
standing in line, and she heard her phone ring.)
```

Errors with participle phrases are sometimes called dangling participles. An incorrect
participle phrase is just dangling there and modifying the wrong noun. Careful writers
make sure that the introductory participle phrase is modifying the intended noun.

Misplaced participle phrases can appear in other positions in a sentence too. These
phrases need to be placed logically. Modifying phrases should appear directly before or
directly after the noun or pronoun that it modifies. If the participle phrases appear

anywhere else in the sentence, you might end up with unintended humor in your
sentence.

```
 The bride was escorted down the aisle by her father, wearing a beautiful
silk gown. (The father-of-the-bride wore a silk gown? The modifier is in the
wrong place.)
 Wearing a beautiful silk gown, the bride was escorted down the aisle by her
father. (correct)
 The lost shoes were found by Dan lying under the couch. (Dan is lying under
the couch? Or were the shoes under the couch? Illogical and confusing.)
 Dan found the lost shoes lying under the couch. (Correct)
```

If you want your sentences to be taken seriously, be sure that your phrases modify the
correct nouns and pronouns.

#### Irregular Verbs

Irregular verbs do not follow our handy rules for forming the past tense. The good news
is that there are fewer than 200 irregular verbs in the English language. The bad news
is that these are words we use a lot.

```
Present Tense Past Tense Present Participle Past Participle
```

```
bring brought bringing brought
```

```
catch caught catching caught
```

```
drive drove driving driven
```

```
fly flew flying flown
```

```
forgive forgave forgiving forgiven
```

```
ring rang ringing rung
```

```
see saw seeing seen
```

```
swim swam swimming swum
```

```
think thought thinking thought
```

```
throw threw throwing thrown
```

```
write wrote writing written
```

Most irregular verbs are words that we use regularly. If it is not a word that you are
familiar with, be sure to check a dictionary for the correct way to form the past tense,
present participle, and past participle.

#### Lay vs Lie

These two verbs are chronically mixed up. They are used incorrectly so often that the
correct version might sound wrong. _Lay_ and _lie_ do not mean the same thing. _Lay_ means
_to set_ or _to place_. For example, _she lay the book on the table. Lie_ means something
else. For now, let‟s ignore the definition that refers to an untruth. _Lie_ means _to recline or_
_to rest_. For example, _go lie down for a nap_.

Remember transitive and intransitive verbs from the beginning of the chapter? This is a
case where it is important to know the difference.

_Lie_ is an intransitive verb. It does not need a direct object in order to make sense.
People _lie_ down. _Down_ is not the direct object; it is just showing how people lie.

```
 I will lie down for a nap. (present tense. Down is not a direct object.)
 Fred told the dog to lie down. (Present tense)
```

_Lay_ is a transitive verb. _Lay_ requires a direct object in order to make sense.

```
 He lay the book on the table. (Book is the direct object.)
 Mary lay the baby in the crib. (Baby is the direct object.)
```

Things get confusing when we move out of present tense.

```
Present Past Present
Participle
```

```
Past
Participle
```

**Lie** (Intransitive) No Direct
Object

```
lie lay lying lain
```

**Lay** (Transitive) Direct
Object Required

```
lay laid (not
laying)
```

```
laying laid
```

The mix up with these two words happens because the past tense of _lie_ is _lay_. This is
where it becomes very important to know if the verb is transitive or intransitive.

Lie is an intransitive verb and does need a direct object in order to complete the
meaning of the sentence. The subject is performing the action of the verb _lie_.

```
 I will lie down for a nap. (Present tense of the verb lie)
 Yesterday, he lay down for a nap at 2. (Past tense of the verb lie)
 Fred is lying on the couch. (Present participle of the verb lie)
 Those newspapers have lain on the counter for weeks. (Past participle of the
verb lie)
```

Lay is a transitive verb and requires a direct object in order to complete the meaning of
the sentence.

```
 He lay the book on the desk. (Present tense of the verb lay. Book is the direct
object.)
 He laid the report there yesterday. (Past tense of the verb lay. Report is the
direct object.)
 She is laying new flooring in the bathroom today. (Present participle of the verb
lay. Flooring is the direct object.)
 She has laid tile flooring before. (Past participle of the verb lay. Flooring is the
direct object.)
```

Popular music gets lay and lie wrong all time. Bob Dylan, Woodie Guthrie, Kris
Kristofferson, Chasing Cars, Miley Cyrus, Eric Clapton, and many other musicians use
lay/lie incorrectly in their music. Why do they use it incorrectly? Musicians might be
trying to avoid the _untruth_ definition of _lie_, and use _lay_ to avoid confusion. It is also
possible that they used _lay_ because it rhymed with another lyric. The third option is that
they don‟t know the difference. The bottom line is, don‟t rely on Miley Cyrus or other
musicians to teach the rules of grammar. Sometimes they get it right, and sometimes
they get it wrong.

**Chapter 6**

## Subject/Verb Agreement

In a sentence, a verb needs to agree in number with the subject. Singular subjects need
singular verbs. Plural subjects need plural verbs.

```
 I am tired. (singular subject/singular verb)
 We are tired. (plural subject/plural verb)
 The writing assignment was due. (singular subject/singular verb)
 Several writing assignments were due. (plural subject/plural verb)
 The student listens. (singular subject/singular verb) 3
rd person singular verbs
require an “s.”
```

#### Finding the subject

The key to subject verb agreement is locating the subject of the sentence. This can be
tricky when other words get in the way of the subject.

**Prepositional phrases** can appear in your sentence and disguise the true subject. The
subject of a verb is never found in a prepositional phrase. Ignore the prepositional
phrase when locating the subject. Common prepositions include _of, to, in, from, for,_
_with, at, on, except,_ and _between_.

```
 The names on the invitation were Fred and Mary.
```

```
 The information from the president is listed below.
 Everyone except Fred is attending the party.
 The bill at the restaurant was paid in full.
```

Subjects can be difficult to find when they appear near phrases that begin with the
words _along with, as well as, in addition to, such as, including, together with, plus, and_
_other._ These are called **parenthetical phrases**, and they are often set apart from the
rest of the sentence with commas. Parenthetical phrases do not contain sentence
subjects. The information in the parenthetical phrase is de-emphasized in the sentence.
It is not as important to the sentence as the subject. It is fine to use these phrases, but
ignore them when locating the subject of the sentence.

```
 Fred, together with his entire family, is attending the conference.
 The manager, along with all of her employees, has received a raise.
 The job application, plus tips on how to ace an interview, is listed online.
```

If the sentence seems awkward, you can rewrite it to sound more natural. One option is
to add the information in the parenthetical phrase to the subject. This creates a
compound subject because it contains two subjects. Rewriting sentence with a
compound subject means that you have to change the verb too.

```
 Fred and his entire family are attending the conference. (plural subject/plural
verb)
 The manager and all of her employees have received a raise. (plural
subject/plural verb)
 The job application and tips on how to ace an interview are listed online. (plural
subject/plural verb)
```

It can be challenging to find the subject in **inverted sentences.** Look for the true subject
**after** the verb. Sentences beginning with _here_ and _there_ are always inverted. Questions
are also written in inverted order. Look for the subject after the verb. If it helps clarify the
subject, you can restore the sentence to the more common subject-verb pattern.

```
 Here are your keys. (Restoring subject-verb pattern: Your keys are here.)
 There are four birds on the fence. (Restoring subject-verb pattern: Four birds are
on the fence there.)
 Where are we? (Restoring subject-verb pattern: We are where?)
 How important are good grades? (Restoring subject-verb pattern: Good grades
are how important?)
```

#### Basic Rules for Subject-Verb Agreement

Once you have located the subject, decide whether the subject is singular or plural and
select the verb that agrees in number. A singular subject requires a singular verb. A
plural subject requires a plural verb. There are a few cases when this can be
challenging.

**Subjects joined by and**
The conjunction _and_ joins words together. When one subject is added to another
subject using the conjunction _and_, the subject is usually plural. The conjunction _and_
adds the subjects together and makes the subject plural. Plural subjects require plural
verbs.

```
 Fred and Mary order coffee every morning. (Fred and Mary form a compound
subject, joined by the word and. Mary and Fred is plural, so the verb order is
plural.)
 Debbie and Dave are flying to Hawaii. (Debbie and Dave form a compound
subject, joined by the word and. Debbie and Dave is plural, so the verb are is
plural.)
```

**Subjects joined by and are singular in only two cases.**

1. When the subjects are preceded by the words each or every, the verb is singular.
Think of it as each and every single thing.

```
 Every student and instructor is eligible for a prize. (Think of the sentence as,
“Every single student and every single instructor is eligible for a prize.”)
 Each report and check needs to be signed. (Think of the sentence as, “Each
individual report and each individual check needs to be signed.”)
```

2. When the subject joined by and represents a single person or thing, it is considered
singular. For example, macaroni and cheese is a singular noun. It refers to one dish.

```
 Macaroni and cheese is her favorite meal. (Macaroni and cheese represents a
single dish, so the subject is singular.)
```

**Subjects joined by or or nor**
When two or more subjects are joined by _or_ or _nor_, the conjunction _or_ and _nor_ means it
is either one or the other. _Or_ does not add the subjects together. _Or_ implies a choice
between one or the other. **The verb must agree with the closest subject in the**
**sentence.** It often helps to ignore the other half of the sentence when choosing the
correct verb.

```
 Either you or Sam was responsible for bringing the coffee. (The closest subject is
Sam. The verb agrees with Sam.)
```

```
 Either Sam or you were responsible for bringing the coffee. (The closest subject
is you. The verb agrees with you.)
 Neither the cats nor the dog is eating. (The closest subject is dog. The verb
agrees with dog.)
 Neither the dog nor the cats are eating. (The closest subject is cats. The verb
agrees with cats.)
```

When dealing with subjects joined by _or_ or _nor_, if one part is singular and the other part
is plural, it often sounds more natural to put the plural part closer to the verb.

```
 Neither the packages nor the letter was delivered on time. (Grammatically
correct, but might sound awkward.)
 Neither the letter nor the packages were delivered on time. (Grammatically
correct and sounds natural.)
```

**TIP: Either always pairs up with or. Neither always pairs up with nor.**

**Company and Organization Names**

Company names require singular verbs, even if they end in the letter _s_. Companies
such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Macy‟s might look plural, but they are
considered singular; therefore, they require singular verbs.

```
 Starbucks is hiring. (Starbucks is the name of a single company, so the verb
needs to be singular as well.)
 Southwest Airlines has many flights to Las Vegas. (Southwest Airlines is the
name of a single company.)
 Jones & Associates is located in Phoenix. (Jones & Associates is the name of a
single company.)
```

#### Challenges with Subject/Verb Agreement

**Indefinite Pronouns**

Indefinite pronouns are vague, and figuring out whether an indefinite pronoun is singular
or plural can be challenging. _Everybody_ sounds like a lot of people, but it is considered
singular. Some indefinite pronouns are always singular, and some are always plural. Be
sure to check the chart if you are not sure. Singular pronouns require singular verbs.
Plural pronouns require plural verbs.

Some indefinite pronouns are singular or plural depending on how they are being used
in a sentence. _All, more, most, some, any,_ and _none_ can be singular or plural,
depending on how they are being used in a sentence. Occasionally, a prepositional
phrase will reveal whether the subject is plural or singular. Be cautious, a prepositional
phrase will never contain the subject, but it might reveal whether the indefinite pronoun
is singular or plural.

```
 Everyone in the family is here. (singular subject/singular verb)
 Both are good choices. (plural subject/plural verb)
 Most of the students are here today. (Most is plural in this sentence. The
prepositional phrase reveals that most refers to the students. Plural subject/plural
verb)
 Most of her coffee is gone. (Most is singular in this sentence. The prepositional
phrase reveals that most refers to her coffee. Singular subject/singular verb)
```

```
Always Singular Always Plural Singular or plural
```

```
Anyone anybody both all
```

```
Anything each few any
```

```
Either every many more
```

```
Everyone everybody several most
```

```
Everything neither none
```

```
No one nobody some
```

```
Nothing someone
```

```
Somebody something
```

**Collective Nouns as Subjects**

Collective nouns such as _committee, jury, team, group, family, crowd, class, flock,_ and
_audience_ may be singular or plural depending on how they are being used in the
sentence. If the collective noun is acting as a unit, then it is singular and requires a
singular verb. In most cases, the collective noun is acting as a singular unit. If the
collective noun is acting separately, then the noun is considered plural and requires a
plural verb. This can sound awkward. It often helps to rewrite the sentence so the
subject is plural.

```
 The team has worked well together all season. (Team is acting as a singular
unit.)
 The class is working hard on the assignment. (Class is acting as a singular
unit.)
 The jury were divided in their opinions. (The jury is not acting as a unit, so it is
plural. It sounds awkward, but it is grammatically correct. It sounds better to say
The jury members were divided in their opinions.)
 The team were practicing individually before the game. (The team is not acting
as a unit, so it is considered plural. It sounds awkward. It sounds better to say
The team members were practicing individually before the game.)
```

**Distinction between the number and a number**
When the word _number_ is the subject of a sentence, the adjective article (_the_ or _a_)
reveals whether the noun is singular or plural.

**The** number = singular
**A** number = plural

```
 A number of students are sick today. (plural subject/plural verb)
 The number of students absent today is low. (singular subject/singular verb)
 A number of animals are featured at the zoo this month. (plural subject/plural
verb)
 The number of text messages sent last month is too high. (singular
subject/singular verb)
```

**Quantities and Measures**
When quantities and measures refer to total amounts, the subject is singular.

```
 Two hundred dollars is a lot to spend on a pair of jeans. (Two hundred dollars is
the total amount. Singular subject/singular verb)
 Ten miles is a long way to run in an afternoon. (Ten miles is the total amount.
Singular subject/singular verb)
```

If the quantities are referring to individual amounts, then the subject is considered plural.

```
 Two hundred quarters were lost at the casino. (The quarters are not acting as a
unit, but as 200 individual quarters. Plural subject/plural verb)
 Four days a month are set aside for meetings. (The four days are not acting as a
unit, but as four individual days. Plural subject/plural verb)
```

**Fractions, portions, and percentages**
Fractions, portions, and percentages can serve as the subject of a sentence. Fractions,
portions, and percentages may be singular or plural depending on the nouns they refer
to in the same sentence. The prepositional phrase often offers a clue to help determine
whether the subject is singular or plural.

```
 One third of the assignment was incorrect. (One third is singular because it
refers to a singular assignment.)
 Only one third of the students are here on time. (One third is plural because it
refers to the plural noun students.)
 A percentage of the report covers new research. (A percentage is singular
because it refers to a single report.)
 A percentage of the books were checked out by Mary. (A percentage is plural
because it refers to many books.)
```

## Adjectives and Adverbs

Adjectives and adverbs are modifiers, and they add description and texture to
sentences. Although adjectives and adverbs have similar jobs, they do not have the
same job. Adjectives modify and describe nouns and pronouns. Adverbs modify and
describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Without adjectives and adverbs, our
language would sound bland.

```
 (Without adjectives or adverbs) She wore a hat.
 (With adjectives and adverbs) She proudly wore a gigantic, blue cowboy hat.
```

Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the second sentence provides more
information.

#### Adjectives

Adjectives modify and describe nouns and pronouns. _Three, purple, large,_ and _tall_ are
all adjectives. Adjectives are added to nouns to answer the questions _what kind is it?_,
_what color is it?, which one is it?_, or _how many are there_?

```
 I like yellow houses. (Adjectives answer the question what color?)
 Fred likes gourmet meals. (Adjectives answer the question what kind?)
 The thick book sat open on the table. (Adjectives answer the question which
one?)
 Three birds sat on the fence. (Adjectives answer the question how many?)
```

Adjectives also follow linking verbs. Linking verbs are all forms of the verb _be_, and can
also be sensing verbs such as _taste, smell, look_, or _feel_. If the sensing verb is
describing an action, then it is working as an action verb. If the sensing verb is
describing a state of being, then it is working as a linking verb.

```
 The basketball player is tall. (The adjective tall follows the linking verb is.)
 The flowers are pink. (The adjective pink follows the linking verb are.)
 I feel bad about breaking the dish. (Not badly. The adjective bad follows the
linking verb feel. If feel was working as an action verb, it would change the
meaning of the sentence. I feel badly means that something is wrong with your
sense of touch.)
 Mary looks good in her new outfit. (Not well. The adjective good follows the
linking verb looks.)
```

**Articles**

Articles are a specific category of adjectives. _A, an,_ and _the_ are adjectives that appear
immediately before nouns, making the noun specific or nonspecific.

**The** is a **definite article**. The article _the_ describes a specific person, place, or thing.

```
 Please bring the book to class. (describes a specific book)
 She went to the store. (she went to a specific store)
 He wants the motorcycle. (He wants a specific motorcycle)
```

**A and an** are **indefinite articles** and are used to describe people, places, or things in
general. When do you use _a_ and when do you use _an_? It depends on the word that
comes next. **A** is used before words with a consonant sound, such as _a shop, a coffee,_
_a bike, a book, a one-week trip,_ and _a unit_.

```
 Please bring a book to class. (it doesn‟t matter which book)
 She went to a store. (it doesn‟t matter which store)
 He wants a motorcycle. (He wants a motorcycle, and he doesn‟t care which one.)
```

**An** is used before words with a vowel sound, such as _an honor, an hour, an employee_,
and _an umbrella_. The word does not have to begin with a vowel, but it has to make the
vowel sound. Be careful with words that start with _h, u,_ and _o_. These letters can make
consonant sounds and vowel sounds.

```
 It is a historic event, and he is an honorable man.
 She took an umbrella on a Utopian vacation.
 Fred left an onion on the counter when he went on a one-week vacation.
```

**Demonstrative Adjectives**

_This, that, these_, and _those_ are all demonstrative adjectives. Demonstrative adjectives
must agree in number with the nouns they modify. Demonstrative adjectives also reveal
whether the noun is nearby or at a distance.

**This** - singular adjective and shows that the noun it modifies is nearby
**These** - plural adjective and shows that the noun it modifies is nearby
**That** - singular and at a distance
**Those** - plural and at a distance

```
 These shoes are great! (The adjective and the noun are plural. The shoes are
nearby.)
 Those shoes were too expensive. (The adjective and noun are plural. The shoes
are at a distance.)
 That class is interesting. (The adjective and the noun are singular. The class is at
a distance.)
 This class is my favorite. (The adjective and the noun are singular. The class is
nearby.)
```

**Possessive Adjectives**

Possessive adjectives appear before the nouns they describe. _My car, our garden, your_
_vacation, his hat, her coffee, its schedule,_ and _their retreat_.

```
 His car was in the shop, but he got a ride in her car.
 I lost my book at your house.
```

**Compound Adjectives**

Compound adjectives are formed when two or more words are joined together to form a
single adjective. Compound adjectives are hyphenated if they appear immediately
before the noun they modify. If the compound adjective appears after the noun, they are
usually not hyphenated. Some compound adjectives are always hyphenated no matter
where they appear in a sentence. _First-class, well-known, short-term, old-fashioned, up-_
_to-date_, and _full-time_ are always hyphenated. If a dictionary lists the compound
adjective with hyphens, then it is considered permanently hyphenated.

```
 The five-year-old child is five years old. (hyphenated before the noun, but not
after)
 A 15-year loan takes 15 years to pay off. (hyphenated before the noun, but not
after)
```

```
 Dave and Sarah had first-class seats to a well-known resort. (permanently
hyphenated compound adjectives)
```

**Hyphens are used even if part of the compound adjective is implied.**

```
 Several two- and three-bedroom apartments are for rent.
 They are hiring many part- and full-time employees.
```

Compound adjectives can use hyphens, but adverbs are not hyphenated when they
appear before a noun. _Newly opened clinic, freshly painted room, individually wrapped_
_candy_, and _highly respected musician_ would not be hyphenated because they contain
an adverb. Adverbs often end in -ly and are never hyphenated.

**Coordinating Adjectives and Cumulative Adjectives**

Sometimes it takes more than one adjective to describe a noun. If the adjectives are
working independently to modify and describe the noun, they are called coordinating
adjectives. Coordinating adjectives need to be separated with commas. To test whether
the adjectives need a comma separating them, run the sentence through the following
test.

1. Mentally add the word and between the adjectives. If the sentence still makes
sense, then move on to the second rule.
2. Mentally reverse the order of the adjectives. Does the sentence still make
sense?

If the sentence still makes sense, then the adjectives are working independently and a
comma is needed between them.

```
 The fluffy, yellow cat sat in the sun. (Coordinating adjectives separated with a
comma. Does it pass the test? The yellow and fluffy cat sat in the window. It still
makes sense. A comma is needed between the adjectives.)
```

```
 Sarah is an intelligent, motivated student. (Coordinating adjectives separated
with a comma. Does it pass the test? Sarah is a motivated and intelligent
student. It still makes sense. A comma is needed between the adjectives.)
```

If the sentence does not pass the test, then do not add the comma between the
adjectives. These adjectives are called **cumulative adjectives** because they build on
one another and need to stay in a specific order. No commas are needed between
cumulative adjectives.

```
 The efficient administrative assistant got the work done in record time. (No
comma separating the adjectives. Does it pass the comma test? The
administrative and efficient assistant got the work done in record time. It does not
pass the test, so no commas are needed between the adjectives.)
```

```
 The red sports car was speeding. (No comma separating the adjectives. Does it
pass the comma test? The sports and red car was speeding. It does not pass the
test, so no commas are needed between the adjectives.)
```

## Adverbs

Adverbs describe and modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Adverbs can also
modify phrases or entire sentences. The word _verb_ is inside the word _adverb_, so it is
easy to remember that adverbs describe verbs. Many adverbs end in -ly, but some of
the most common adverbs do not, including _always, indeed, here, there, tomorrow,_
_today, later, never, now, sometimes, soon, when, where, not,_ and _too_. Adverbs explain
_where, when, how_, and _to what extent_.

```
 Yesterday Fred arrived at work early. (Adverbs explain when)
 Please put your dirty dishes there. (Adverb explains where)
 Mary ran so quickly that she finished early. (Adverb explains to what extent,
how, and when.)
```

Adverbs also follow action verbs.

```
 The students listened carefully to the instructions. (Not careful. Adverbs follow
action verbs)
 The dinner party went smoothly. (Not smooth. Adverbs follow action verbs)
 It rained unusually hard on Sunday. (Both unusually and hard are adverbs.)
```

Some adverbs have two acceptable forms: slow, slowly; quick, quickly; deep, deeply;
direct, directly; and close, closely.

```
 Sarah drove slowly. (Or less formal: Sarah drove slow to the game.)
 Fred called the president directly. (Or less formal: Fred called the president
direct.)
```

**Double Negatives**

Double negatives occur when a negative adverb (_no, not, nothing, none, hardly, barely_)
is used with a negative verb (_didn’t, don’t, won’t_). Double negatives are considered
unprofessional and grammatically incorrect.

```
 He doesn’t never drink coffee. (Double negative)
 He doesn’t drink coffee. (correct)
 He never drinks coffee. (correct)
```

```
 Mary can’t barely see without her glasses. (Double negative)
 Mary can barely see without her glasses. (correct)
 Mary can’t see without her glasses. (correct, but changes the meaning slightly)
```

## Comparative and Superlative Forms

Do you need to compare something in your sentence? Adjectives work to compare
nouns and pronouns. Adverbs are used to compare verbs. Adjectives and adverbs have
three degrees: positive, comparative, and superlative. The **positive degree** of an
adjective or adverb is used when it modifies only one word. The **comparative degree** is
used when comparing two items. The **superlative degree** is used to compare three or
more items.

**Comparative/Superlative Adjectives**

The comparative degree of one- and two-syllable adjectives is formed by adding _-r_ or _-_
_er_ to the ending (_newer, older, taller, shorter_). The superlative degree of one- and two-
syllable adjectives is formed by adding _-st_ or _-est_ to the ending (_newest, oldest, tallest,_
_shortest_). If the adjective ends in _y_, change the _y_ to _i_ before adding _-er_ (for comparative)
or _-est_ (for superlative).

Long adjectives (three or more syllables) and adjectives that are difficult to pronounce
form the comparative and superlative degrees by adding the words _more_ and _most_
(_more beneficial, most beneficial_) and _less_ and _least_ (_less popular, least popular_).

**Regular Adjectives**
**Positive**
Used to describe
the word

```
Comparative
Used to compare two
persons or things
(usually add r or er)
```

```
Superlative
Used to compare three
or more persons or
things
(usually add st or est)
```

**One syllable** old older oldest

**Two syllables** quiet quieter quietest

**Ending in y** happy happier happiest

**Two syllables**
**(awkward)**

```
useful more/less useful most/least useful
```

**Three or more**
**syllables**

```
advantageous more/less
advantageous
```

```
most/least
advantageous
```

```
 Mary‟s shoes are new. (Positive degree)
 Sarah‟s shoes are newer than Mary‟s shoes. (Comparative degree)
 Fred‟s shoes are the newest in the family. (Superlative degree)
```

```
 The new copy machine is efficient. (Positive degree)
 The new copy machine is more efficient than the last copy machine.
(Comparative degree)
 The new copy machine is the most efficient one on campus. (Superlative
degree)
```

Some adjectives do not follow the rules when forming their comparative and superlative
degrees. These are called irregular adjectives. They play by their own rules.

**Adjective Comparative Superlative**

**bad** worse worst

**good** better best

**little** less least

**many** more most

**Comparative/Superlative Adverbs**

Adverbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. One-syllable adverbs
form their comparative degree by adding _-r_ or _-er_ to the ending. One-syllable adverbs
form their superlative degree by adding _-st_ or _-est_ to the ending. Most adverbs are
longer than one syllable. Adverbs with two or more syllables form their comparative by
adding _more_ or _most_ (_more cautiously_) or _less_ or _least_ (_less cautiously_).

**Regular Adverbs**
**Positive Comparative**
Add _r_ or _er_ for one-syllable
adverbs. Most use
_more/less._

```
Superlative
Add st or est to one-
syllable adverbs. Most use
most/least.
```

**One syllable** fast faster fastest

**Two or more**
**syllables**

```
neatly more/less neatly most/least neatly
```

**Two or more**
**syllables**

```
carefully more/less carefully most/least carefully
```

**Two or more**
**syllables**

```
beautifully more/less beautifully most/least beautifully
```

Some adverbs form their comparative and superlative degrees irregularly. These are
called irregular adverbs, and they play by their own rules. It is a good idea to check a
current dictionary if you are uncertain.

**Irregular Adverbs**

**Adverb Comparative Superlative**

**well** better best

**much** more most

**badly** worse worst

#### Commonly Confused Adjectives and Adverbs

Adjectives and adverbs do similar jobs, so it is easy to get them mixed up. Adjectives
describe nouns and pronouns. Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.

**Almost** (adj. - nearly): Almost everyone is here today.
**Most** (adj. - greatest in amount): Most students are happy that midterms are over.

**Farther** (adverb - distance): How much farther are we driving?
**Further** (adverb - additionally): We should talk about this further.
**TIP**: the word _far_ is hidden in the word _farther_. Farther refers to distance.

**Sure** (adj. - certain): She is sure that she wants to go on vacation.

**Surely** (adverb - certainly): He will surely win the gold medal.

**Later** (adverb - after a certain time): He will sign the contract later.
**Latter** (adj. - the second of two things): Between the tea and the coffee, I choose the
latter.

**Fewer** (adj. - refers to countable items): Ten items or fewer are allowed in this checkout
lane.
**Less** (adj. - refers to amounts or quantities): There is less water in Lake Washington
than in the Pacific Ocean.
**TIP:** use **fewer** with nouns you can count individually, and **less** with nouns you cannot
count individually.

**Real** (adj. - actual, genuine) A real diamond is worth more than a fake diamond.
**Really** (adverb - actually, truly) He is really excited to go on vacation.

**Good** (adj. desirable) A number of students received a good score on the test.
**Well** (adv. satisfactorily): He did well on the exam.
(adv. healthy): He feels well enough to go to school.

#### Adverb and Adjective Placement

Adverb and adjectives should be placed close to the words they describe, especially
with the words _only, merely, first, almost_, and _last_. The position of the adjective or
adverb can change the meaning of the sentence.

```
 Only Mary can get the project done. (Mary is the only person that can get the
project done.)
 Mary can only get the project done. (Mary cannot do anything else. She can only
get the project done.)
```

Be sure to proofread your sentences carefully. Even when the adverb or adjective is
close to the word it is modifying, the placement can affect the entire meaning of the
sentence.

```
 The boss noticed that only Fred took notes at the meeting. (Fred was the only
person at the meeting taking notes.)
 The boss noticed that Fred only took notes at the meeting. (Fred didn‟t
participate in any other way at the meeting. He only took notes.)
```

```
 He hit almost every car in the parking lot. (He hit a majority of the cars in the
parking lot.)
```

```
 He almost hit every car in the parking lot. (He came close to hitting a majority of
the cars in the parking lot, but he missed them all.)
```

**Chapter 8**

## Prepositions

Prepositions show the relationship of a noun or pronoun in time or space. Where are
your keys? They are **on** _the counter,_ **in** _your purse,_ **under** _the book, or_ **between** _the_
_groceries_. Prepositions can also show ownership, for example: _the wines_ **of** _France, the_
_beaches_ **of** _Hawaii, or the motorcycle belonging_ **to** _Fred._ Prepositions can show
possession, location, direction, time, and figurative location.

**Direction** - _toward, to, into, across, down, up_

**Location** - _at, above, behind, across, beside, under, between, among, by, near,_
_toward, in (Think of it as anywhere your keys could be hiding)_

**Time** - _before, during, after, until, since_

**Figurative location** - _for, against, with_

**Possession** - _of, to_

Prepositions are team players; they cannot act alone. A preposition acts as part of a
prepositional phrase, which includes the preposition, the object of the preposition, and
any modifiers. The object of the preposition is always a noun or pronoun.

```
 Please put your phone on the table. (On is the preposition. The object of the
preposition is table. The is a modifier.)
 Dan found the book under the couch. (Under is the preposition. The object of the
preposition is couch. The is a modifier)
 Christie went to class. (To is the preposition. The object of the preposition is
class.)
```

#### Prepositions and Pronouns

If the object of a preposition is a pronoun, then it must be in the objective case (him,
her, you, them, me, us).

```
 Let‟s keep the information between you and me. (Not I) Between is the
preposition. The objects of the preposition are you and me.
 Students like Nancy and him are rare. (Not he) Like is the preposition. The
objects of the preposition are Nancy and him.
 Dave sat beside me at the concert. (Not I) Beside is the preposition. The object
of the preposition is me.
```

#### Common Preposition Errors

**Would’ve, could’ve, should’ve**
Would‟ve, could‟ve, and should‟ve are contractions of the verb phrases would have,
could have, and should have. When people use the contractions, it might sound like
they are saying _would of, could of,_ and _should of_. It might sound similar when spoken,
but it looks different when it is written. The verb phrases are _would have_ (or _would’ve_),
_could have (_or _could’ve)_ and _should have (_or _should’ve)_. _Would of_ is never correct.

```
 Nancy should have brought her book to class. (Not should of)
 Steve could have won the race. (Not could of)
 He would have brought the doughnuts, but the shop was closed. (Not would of)
```

**From, off, off of**
_From_ and _off_ are both prepositions, but they do not mean the same thing. They are not
interchangeable. _Off_ is the opposite of _on_; be sure that meaning works in your sentence.
Some people say “_off of_” instead of “_off_.” This is considered informal. The extra
preposition is not necessary for clarity, but it slips into casual conversation. For formal
documents, do not add “of” unless it is necessary for clarity.

```
 Fred borrowed the book from Sarah. (Not off) In order to borrow a book “off”
Sarah, then the book would need to first be “on” Sarah. Is she wearing the book?
Probably not. Does she own the book? Yes. Fred borrowed the book from Sarah.
```

```
 Mary jumped off the diving board. (Not off of) The meaning is clear and concise
without the additional preposition.
```

**To and too**

_To_ and _too_ are have different meanings and they are not interchangeable. The
preposition _to_ means “moving toward.” The adverb _too_ means “additionally, excessively,
or also.”

```
 They wanted to go to the movie.
```

```
 The movie was too long.
```

#### Commonly Confused Prepositions

Many prepositions do similar jobs, so it is common to get confused about which one to
use.

**Among/between**
**Among** is usually used to speak of three or more people or things.
**Between** is usually used to speak of only two people or things.

```
 The border between California and Oregon is very mountainous.
 Please divide the pie evenly among the six children.
```

**Beside/besides**
**Beside** means _next to_.
**Besides** means _in addition to_.

```
 The woman standing beside me in line ordered the last scone.
 Besides the scone, she ordered two lattes and a muffin.
```

**Except/accept**
_Except_ and _accept_ are different parts of speech. They might sound similar when
spoken, but they are different.
**Except** is a preposition meaning “excluding” or “but.”
**Accept** is a verb meaning “consent to receive.”

```
 Everyone except Andrew was at school.
 Ava will accept the award on his behalf.
```

**In, into, in to**
**In** shows a location or position
**Into** has three meanings and all of them show action:

1. Entering something
2. Changing form
3. Making contact
In to can happen when using the preposition in, followed by the word to. These words
can show up next to each other in a sentence.

```
 The chocolate chip cookies were in the kitchen. (location)
 She walked into the kitchen to get a cookie. (entering something)
 She drove in to see Fred. (preposition in followed by the infinitive to see)
 He bumped into Steve last week. (making contact)
 The caterpillar turned into a butterfly. (changing form)
```

**Like, as, as if, as though**
_Like_ can be used as a preposition to introduce a noun or a pronoun. Do not use it to
introduce a clause. If everything after the word _like_ could form a complete sentence,
then _like_ is not being used correctly. Use **as, as if,** or **as though** to introduce clauses.

```
 Mary looks like a movie star. (Like introduces the noun star.)
 He looks as though he needs a vacation. (He needs a vacation is an independent
clause.)
 She looks as if she had a haircut. (She had a haircut is an independent clause.)
 As I said in my text message, I am going to Starbucks now. (Not like. I said in my
text message is an independent clause.)
```

#### Necessary and Unnecessary Prepositions

**Necessary prepositions**
Prepositions are useful words. They show a relationship between a noun and other
words in the sentence. Don‟t eliminate prepositions that are required for clarity in your
sentence. Be careful when two prepositions modify a single object in your sentence.

```
 What did you step on earlier? (On is necessary for clarity in this sentence.)
 Fred graduated from college. (From is necessary for clarity.)
 My interest in and commitment to your program remain high. (In and to are both
prepositions with the same object: program.)
```

**Unnecessary prepositions**

Too many prepositions can clutter sentences up with unnecessary wordiness. Business
writing should be clear and concise. Eliminating unnecessary prepositions tightens up
your writing. If the preposition is not needed for clarity, then remove it from your
sentence.

```
 Where are you? (Not where are you at?)
 Both students performed well on the test. (Not both of the students)
 Mary jumped off the diving board. (Not off of the diving board)
```

Many writers overuse the preposition “of.” Grammar Girl writes, “Of is a preposition, and
although it‟s not an inherently evil word, overusing it can make your writing sound
passive and fussy.” [http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/do-you-](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/do-you-)

#### Ending Sentences with a Preposition

Many people were taught that ending a sentence with a preposition is a major
grammatical crime. The truth is, there is not a rule saying it is wrong. Because so many
people were taught that it was wrong, it is better to err on the safe side. In formal
writing, such as cover letters and resumes, avoid ending sentences with a preposition.
Ending a sentence with a preposition is acceptable in informal writing.

```
 When you called earlier, whom did you speak to? (informal)
 When you called earlier, to whom did you speak? (formal)
```

```
 What are these cookies made of? (informal)
 What ingredients are in these cookies? (formal)
```

According to Grammarmonster.com
_Try to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition. This is not really a rule, but_
_lots of people think it is. So, to ensure you don't annoy your readers, just avoid_
_the situation. If rewording your sentence makes it sound too contrived, just go for_
_it and end your sentence with a preposition. (Sometimes, the cure is worse than_
_the "problem.")_

#### Idioms

Idioms are words and phrases that have a figurative meaning that is different from its
literal meaning. Many idioms contain prepositions, but the literal meaning of the
preposition is different from the implied meaning. For example, “under the weather”
does not make sense if you take the phrase literally. It has nothing to do with the
weather. Native speakers know that “under the weather” means that someone is feeling
sick. _Dave is under the weather today_ means that he is not feeling well. Every language
has its own idioms. If you are not sure of the meaning, be sure to look it up.

**agree on** (mutual ideas) The members **agree on** the uniform changes.
**agree to** (a proposal or to undertake an action) Did you **agree to** the current
proposal?
She **agreed to** the change in schedule.
**agree with** (a person) I **agree with** you. We **agree with** her idea.

**angry about** (a situation) Sarah was **angry about** being late for work.
**angry at** (a thing) Dan was **angry at** the coffee machine for breaking this morning.
**angry with** (a person) Are you angry with me? Theresa was **angry with** Johnny for
forgetting her birthday.

**behind the scenes** (unseen) All of the preparation for the beautiful dinner
happened **behind the scenes**.

**by heart** (from memory) She knows all of the words to the song **by heart**.

**correspond to** (a thing) A skier‟s success **corresponds to** the proper snow
conditions.
**correspond with** (a person) Steve and Fred **correspond with** each other on
Facebook.

**differ from** (things) Running shoes **differ from** hiking boots.
**differ with** (people) I **differ with** you on many points.

**different from (not than)** This coffee is **different from** the one I had yesterday.

**expert in (not on)** Dan is an **expert in** electrical engineering.

**out of the blue** (unexpectedly) His marriage proposal came **out of the blue** and
took Sarah by surprise.

**plan to (not on)** We **plan to** vacation in Hawaii.

**retroactive to (not from)** Your raise is **retroactive to** August 15, 2013.

**speak to** (tell something) I must **speak to** the manager immediately.

**speak with** (discuss with) They enjoyed **speaking with** you last week.

**up in the air** (uncertain) Our plans are **up in the air** until we hear from Kim.

## Conjunctions

A conjunction connects words, phrases, and clauses. On Team Grammar, conjunctions
work as the joiners.

#### Coordinating conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions connect words, phrases, and clauses of equal value in a
sentence. The coordinating conjunctions are easy to remember with the acronym
FANBOYS, which represents **for, and, nor, but, or, yet,** and **so**.

```
 Mary and Sarah went skiing on the mountain. (And joins equal nouns.)
 Mary drove the car on the way to the resort, but Sarah drove the car on the way
home. (But joins equal clauses.)
 Neither Mary nor Fred remembered to call home. (Nor joins equal nouns.)
```

_Yet_ and _for_ are not as common as the other coordinating conjunctions.

```
 The ski resort was very busy, for it was a holiday weekend. (For joins equal
clauses.)
 They visited the new ski resort, yet they stayed at their favorite hotel in town.
(Yet joins equal clauses.)
```

The word _so_ should only be used as a coordinating conjunction in informal writing. In
formal writing, the conjunctive adverbs **therefore** and **consequently** can be substituted
for the coordinating conjunction _so_. Conjunctive adverbs require a semicolon and a
comma to set them apart from the rest of the sentence.

Another option to avoid using _so_ is to remove the conjunction and begin the sentence
with **because** or **although**. This changes one of the independent clauses into a
dependent clause. No conjunction is needed to join these two clauses together.

```
 Mary‟s car broke down on her way to work, so she had to take the bus. (Informal)
 Because Mary‟s car broke down on her way to work, she had to take the bus.
(Formal) Dependent clause precedes an independent clause; therefore, a
comma is needed after the dependent clause.
 Mary had to take the bus because her car broke down on her way to work.
(Formal) The independent clause is first in this sentence; therefore, no comma is
needed between the clauses.
 Mary‟s car broke down on her way to work; therefore, she had to take the bus.
(Formal) Conjunctive adverb used
 Mary‟s car broke down on her way to work; consequently, she had to take the
bus. (Formal) Conjunctive adverb used
```

#### Punctuating compound sentences

A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses. Independent clauses
can stand alone as a sentence. To punctuate a compound sentence, place a comma
before the coordinating conjunction. **To determine if a sentence is a compound**
**sentence, remember that the words before and after the conjunction must be able**
**to form complete sentences.**

```
 I swam many laps in the heated pool, and Dave ran five miles on the treadmill.
(comma + conjunction)
 Fred received a text message while he was driving, but he did not look at his
phone. (comma + conjunction)
 Mary cooked dinner on Monday, but Fred cooked dinner the rest of the week.
(comma + conjunction)
```

**Do not use commas when coordinating conjunctions join compound verbs,**
**objects, or phrases. If the words after the conjunction do not form a complete**
**sentence, do not use a comma after the conjunction.**

```
 The school provided transportation to the event and scholarships to the students.
(No comma is needed because and joins the compound objects transportation
and scholarships. To determine if a sentence is a compound sentence, the words
after the conjunction must form a complete sentence. Scholarships to the
students is not a complete sentence.)
 Fred rode to the concert and parked his motorcycle in an underground parking
garage. (No comma is needed because and joins the compound verbs rode and
```

```
parked. Parked his motorcycle in an underground parking garage is not a
complete sentence.)
```

**Independent clause + comma + FANBOYS + independent clause = compound**
**sentence**

#### Conjunctive Adverbs

Conjunctive adverbs are another way to join independent clauses. Conjunctions have
one job: to join words, phrases, and clauses. Sometimes an adverb wants to play on the
conjunction team. When that happens, it is called a conjunctive adverb. A conjunctive
adverb is a connecting word that joins two independent clauses. Conjunctive adverbs
transition from one thought to another thought and are sometimes referred to as
transitional conjunctions. A conjunctive adverb requires **a semicolon before it and a**
**comma after it. One syllable conjunctive adverbs such as thus, then, and hence**
**do not require a comma after it.**

**Common conjunctive adverbs include the following:**
accordingly however nevertheless
also in fact otherwise
consequently in the meantime for example
therefore indeed then
hence furthermore moreover
thus for instance likewise

```
 Mary usually drinks coffee every morning; however, today she drank tea.
 The weather is hot today; thus we should go to the beach. (No comma needed
after the conjunctive adverb because thus is only one syllable.)
 Fred forgot his wallet at home; consequently, he was unable to pay for the
meal.
```

#### Parenthetical Adverbs

Many conjunctive adverbs also work as parenthetical adverbs, so be sure to pay
attention to how it is being used in the sentence. _However, therefore, indeed, in the_
_meantime,_ and _likewise_ also work as parenthetical adverbs. Parenthetical adverbs
interrupt the flow of your sentence by appearing in the middle of a clause. Use commas
to set parenthetical adverbs apart in your sentence.

```
 We were, however, happy to pay for the meal. (The parenthetical adverb
interrupts the flow of the sentence and does not join two independent clauses. It
is set apart with commas.)
 I, therefore, appreciate your not texting during class. (The parenthetical adverb
interrupts the flow of the sentence. It is set apart with commas.)
 Mary and Fred, likewise, appreciate your not texting during the meal. (The
parenthetical adverb interrupts the flow of the sentence. It does not join two
independent clauses. It is set apart with commas.)
```

**How can you tell parenthetical adverbs and conjunctive adverbs apart?**
Conjunctive adverbs join two independent clauses together. An independent clause
must appear on both sides of the conjunctive adverb. Parenthetical adverbs appear
within the same clause and interrupt the flow of the sentence. Parenthetical adverbs are
not linking anything together; they are just interrupting the flow of the sentence.

#### Subordinating Conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions join dependent and independent clauses. Dependent and
independent clauses are not grammatically equal, so they cannot use coordinating
conjunctions to join together. Subordinating conjunctions work to join these unequal
clauses. Dependent clauses begin with a subordinating conjunction such as _after,_
_because, although, since, unless, while,_ and _until._ A subordinating conjunction limits
the clause it introduces and makes it dependent on an independent clause.

**If the sentence begins with a dependent clause, then a comma is required**
**between the dependent clause and the independent clause.**

**If your sentence ends with a dependent clause (terminal dependent clause) then**
**no comma is required.** If the terminal dependent clause provides nonessential
information or breaks the flow of the sentence, a comma should be used for clarity.

```
 Although the coffeehouse was crowded, we received our drinks quickly. (The
subordinating conjunction introduces the dependent clause at the beginning of
the sentence, and it is set apart from the independent clause with a comma.)
```

```
 Because it was too crowded to sit inside the coffeehouse, we took our coffees to
the park. (The subordinating conjunction introduces the dependent clause at the
beginning of the sentence, and it is set apart from the independent clause with a
comma.)
```

```
 We took our coffees to the park because it was too crowded to sit inside the
coffeehouse. (The subordinating conjunction is terminal. The dependent clause
ends the sentence; therefore, no comma is needed.)
```

```
 I am certain that I paid my cell phone bill, although I cannot find my receipt. (The
terminal dependent clause adds unnecessary information and is set apart with a
comma for clarity.)
```

#### Parenthetical Clauses

Parenthetical clauses interrupt the flow of the sentence with additional and nonessential
information. These clauses are set apart from the rest of the sentence with commas.

```
 The grammar class, until I hear otherwise, is the most beneficial class on
campus. (Nonessential information is set apart with commas)
 Her shoes, that she bought on sale last week, were ruined in the rain.
(Nonessential information is set apart with commas)
```

#### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are clauses introduced by the relative pronouns _who, whom, whose,_
_which_, and _that._ When relative pronouns introduce a dependent clause, they are
functioning as a conjunction.

**Relative pronoun Refers to Used to introduce**

who, whom, whose people essential and nonessential clauses

that animals and things essential clauses

which animals and things nonessential clauses

***Deciding whether a clause is essential or nonessential can be tricky. An**
**essential clause is needed to identify the noun to which it refers, and no commas**
**should separate this clause from the antecedent.**

```
 A student who wants to earn a good grade must attend class regularly. (The
relative pronoun refers to a person, and it introduces an essential clause. It is
needed to identify which students must attend class regularly.)
 A dog that is adopted from the shelter is happy to have a home. (The relative
pronoun refers to a dog, and it introduces an essential clause.)
```

A nonessential clause contains information that might be interesting, but it is not
necessary. The main clause is understandable without this additional information. If the
clause is nonessential, it is set apart from the sentence with commas on both sides of
the clause.

```
 The coffeehouse, which is right next to the school, serves very delicious coffee
and scones. (The relative pronoun refers to the coffeehouse, but it introduces
nonessential information.)
 Fred, who lives in South Carolina, is an excellent cook. (The relative pronoun
refers to Fred, but it introduces nonessential information.)
```

**Correlative Conjunctions**
Correlative conjunctions join grammatically equal sentence elements and are always
used in pairs. **Both... and, not only... but, either... or,** and **neither... nor**.
When using correlative conjunctions, be sure that the words, phrases, and clauses are
parallel in their construction. Correlative conjunctions show greater emphasis than
coordinating conjunctions.

```
 I not only have the energy for the marathon, but time. (Not parallel)
 I not only have the energy for the marathon, but I have the time too. (Parallel)
```

```
 Either Dave was flying to London or to Tucson. (Not parallel)
 Dave was flying either to London or to Tucson. (Parallel)
```

#### Punctuation Review

**Independent Clause, + FANBOYS + Independent Clause** (A comma is used when a
coordinating conjunction joins independent clauses.)

**Independent Clause; + Conjunctive Adverb, + Independent Clause** (A semicolon
used when a conjunctive adverb joins independent clauses. A comma is added after all
conjunctive adverbs with two or more syllables.)

**Subordinating Conjunction + Dependent Clause, + Independent Clause** (A comma
is used after a dependent clause that is introduced by a subordinating conjunction.)

**Independent Clause + Subordinating Conjunction + Dependent Clause** (No comma
is required with terminal dependent clauses.)

**Chapter 10**

## Commas

A comma is a very useful piece of punctuation. Unfortunately, many people were taught
to use commas whenever they would naturally pause. This myth causes people to
overuse commas and give them punctuation powers that they do not have. Commas
have rules too.

#### Series Comma

A series is a list of three or more items. Commas separate three or more equally ranked
elements (words, phrases, or short clauses) in a list. A comma is needed before the
final conjunction in the list. This comma is called the serial comma. Do not use the
comma if only two items are listed.

```
 She enjoys running, swimming, and rock climbing. (Series of words. Notice that a
comma precedes and; this comma is called the serial comma.)
```

```
 She enjoys running on the track, swimming in the pool, and rock climbing at the
gym. (Series of phrases.)
```

```
 Mary is the owner, Fred is the manager, and Dan is the marketing assistant.
(Series of clauses.)
```

```
 She enjoys swimming and rock climbing. (Only two items listed. No comma
required.)
```

The items in the series must have the same grammatical structure. This is called
**parallel construction**. If two of the three items in a series have articles, then the third
item needs to be rewritten with an article too.

```
 The new student is intelligent, can be depended on, and punctual. (Not parallel
construction. Two of the items on the list are adjectives, but one item on the list
is a phrase.)
 The new student is intelligent, dependable, and punctual. (Parallel
construction. All items on the list are adjectives.)
```

```
 He asked for a hat, a Lego set, and for a gift card. (Not parallel construction.
Two of the items in the series begin with a preposition. This needs to be
rewritten. It can be rewritten so all of the items have the preposition, or only the
first item is preceded by a preposition.)
 He asked for a hat, a Lego set, and a gift card. (Parallel construction.)
 He asked for a hat, for a Lego set, and for a gift card. (Parallel construction, but
a bit wordy.)
```

NOTE: Newspapers follow AP Style. AP Style omits the final comma in a series
unless it is needed for clarity. This final comma is known as the serial comma or the
Oxford comma. This final comma is controversial. Some people insist that you can
leave it off unless it is necessary for clarity. For the sake of consistency, most writers
either always use it or never use it. Unless you are writing an article for a newspaper,
do not omit the final comma.

#### Direct Address

A comma is needed when a person is being spoken to directly. The name of the person
being addressed is set apart with a comma, regardless of where it appears in the
sentence. Names, teams, and groups are set apart from the rest of the sentence with
commas.

```
 Sarah, do you have the realtor‟s phone number? (At the beginning of the
sentence)
```

```
 Are you, the future leaders of America, ready to take the next step? (In the
middle of the sentence)
```

```
 Let‟s eat, grandma! (At the end of the sentence)
```

This comma is important. If you forget to place this comma, it changes the meaning of
the sentence.

#### Adjectives

When two or more adjectives are independently describing the same noun, separate the
adjectives with a comma. How can you tell if the adjectives are working independently?
To test whether the adjectives need a comma separating them, run the sentence
through the following test.

```
 1. Mentally add the word and between the adjectives. If the sentence still makes
sense, then move on to the second rule.
 2. Mentally reverse the order of the adjectives. Does the sentence still make
sense?
```

If the sentence still makes sense, then the adjectives are working independently and a
comma is needed between them.

```
 Jennifer Lawrence is a talented, beautiful actress. (Jennifer Lawrence is a
beautiful and talented actress.)
 The fluffy, yellow cat sat in the sun. (The yellow and fluffy cat sat in the sun.)
```

#### Independent Clauses

When two independent clauses are joined together with a coordinating conjunction, a
comma is needed before the conjunction.

```
 Fred and Mary walked their dog to the park, but they left when it started to rain.
 The rain finally stopped, and the children went to the park to play.
```

#### Introductory Dependent Clauses

Dependent clauses that begin sentences are set apart from the independent clause with
a comma. Dependent clauses usually begin with a subordinating conjunction (Chapter
9). _Although, while, if, because,_ and _when_ are all subordinating conjunctions.

```
 Because it is raining today, I will need to wear my raincoat. (Introductory
dependent clause separated with a comma.)
 Although the forecast shows sunshine, it is currently raining. (Introductory
dependent clause separated with a comma.)
 If you go out in the rain, be sure to wear a coat. (Introductory dependent clause
separated with a comma.)
```

#### Terminal Dependent Clauses

When a dependent clause appears at the end of the sentence, a comma is usually not
necessary. If the dependent clause answers the question _when?, why?,_ or _how?_, then
the clause is essential and does not require a comma. If the dependent clause adds
unnecessary information, then a comma is needed. This isn‟t common, but it is
necessary to separate these afterthoughts with a comma.

```
 Please email me if you have any questions. (The dependent clause at the end of
the sentence provides essential information, so no comma is needed.)
 Mary went to the store because she needed to buy milk. (The dependent clause
at the end of the sentence provides essential information, so no comma is
needed.)
 I intend to grade the writing assignments on Saturday, although I can grade
them earlier if you choose. (The dependent clause provides nonessential
information, so a comma is required.)
```

#### Parenthetical Expressions

Parenthetical words, phrases, and clauses interrupt the flow of the sentence and offer
unessential information to the sentence. Parenthetical expressions can be removed
from the sentence, and the sentence still makes sense. Commas are required to
separate parenthetical elements from the rest of the sentence.

```
 No, I will not be attending the conference. (At the beginning of the sentence)
```

```
 We know, for example, that the book is overpriced. (In the middle of the
sentence)
```

```
 You have checked your writing assignment for accuracy, no doubt. (At the end
of the sentence)
 Marathon training, you must admit, requires a lot of time and stamina. (Commas
are needed because the information is unnecessary.)
 The sweatshirt, which happened to be bright yellow, sat on the sale rack for
weeks. (Commas are needed because the information is unnecessary.)
```

**DO NOT use commas to set off clauses that contain essential information**. If the
clause contains information that is needed to complete the meaning of the sentence,
then no commas are needed. This information is also covered in Chapter 9.

```
 A student who wants to succeed in this class should turn in their assignments
on time. (No commas are necessary because the clause is essential to the
meaning of the sentence.)
 A coffeehouse that offers delicious beverages will succeed in my
neighborhood. (No commas are necessary because the clause is essential to the
meaning.)
```

#### Commas and Appositives

Appositives rename nouns or pronouns. Usually an appositive appears right next to the
noun or pronoun it is renaming. An appositive that provides nonessential information
should be set off by commas.

```
 Sam Jones, the union representative, is here. (The appositive adds
nonessential information; commas set it off.)
```

```
 You may pick up your order at the location closest to your home, our Lynnwood
branch. (The appositive adds nonessential information.)
```

When an appositive is needed to identify the noun or pronoun referred to earlier in the
sentence, do not set it off with commas.

```
 The book Fast Food Nation explains how fast food affects our nation. (The
appositive is needed to identify the specific book; therefore, no commas are
used.)
```

Closely related one-word appositives do not require commas.

```
 My brother Dan sometimes uses my computer.
```

#### Commas and the Adverb too

The adverb _too_ requires different punctuation depending on its meaning in the
sentence. If the sentence uses the word _too_ to mean “also,” it is set apart with commas.
If the adverb appears at the end of a clause, you do not need to separate it with a
comma. If the adverb appears in the middle of a clause, set it apart with commas on
both sides.

_Too_ has an additional meaning. If _too_ is used to mean “excessively,” do not set it apart
with commas.

```
 Many students will be at the event too. (End of the sentence.)
 You, too, can make an entrance at the event. (In the middle of the sentence, set
apart with commas.
 That joke was too funny. (Too means excessively in this sentence. No commas
are needed.)
```

#### Commas and Introductory Phrases

**Introductory Verbal Phrases**
Verb phrases that appear before an independent clause should be followed with
commas. Introductory verbal phrases modify the subject of the main clause. Be sure
that your introductory phrase is modifying the intended subject.

```
 Running the marathon, Mary listened to music with a strong beat. (Introductory
verb phrase separated with a comma)
 Working long hours, we finished the project early. (Introductory verb phrase
separated with a comma)
```

**Introductory Prepositional Phrases**
Prepositional phrases can also introduce sentences. Introductory prepositional phrases
with four words or more should be followed by a comma.

```
 In March we expect the sun to shine. (No comma is needed. Introductory
prepositional phrase is only 2 words)
 By the middle of March, the sun will shine more often in Seattle. (Introductory
prepositional phrase separated with a comma)
```

#### Dates, Time Zones, Addresses, and Geographic

#### Locations

**Dates**
Dates can be comprised of a number of different parts, such as weekday, calendar day,
and year. When writing dates with more than two parts, commas are used to separate
the different elements in the sentence to provide clarity. The month and date are never
separated with commas.

```
 On March 4 we will celebrate a special holiday. (Only two parts. No comma
needed.)
```

```
 On March 4, 2014, we will celebrate a special holiday. (Two commas set off the
third part.)
```

```
 On Tuesday, March 4, 2014, we will finish the chapter. (Month and date are
never separated with commas. Commas separate other parts in this list.)
```

```
 In March 2012 investors saw the stock price increase substantially. (Only two
parts. No comma needed.)
```

**Time Zones**
When writing a sentence that contains a time zone, commas separate the time zone
from the rest of the sentence. Note that commas are used on both sides of the time
zone.

```
 Our flight leaves Seattle at 8:55 a.m., PST, and arrives in New York at 5:05 p.m.,
EST.
```

```
 Dan ordered the flowers at 11:58 p.m., PST, and the coupon expired at midnight.
```

**Addresses**
When addresses are written in a sentence, separate each part of the address with
commas. Do not place a comma between the state and the zip code.

```
 Please send a copy of your passport to Epic Adventures, 14567 NE Aardvark
Place, Seattle, WA 98101, before your trip. (Commas are used between all
elements except the state and zip code, which are considered a single unit.)
```

```
 Edmonds Community College is located at 20000 68th Avenue West, Lynnwood,
WA 98036. (Commas are used between all elements except state and zip code,
which are considered a single unit.)
```

**Geographic Locations**
When referring to a location with both the city and the state, separate the city from the
state with commas. Commas are used on both sides of the state name unless the state
appears at the end of the sentence. Commas are also used to set off the name of a
country when it follows the name of a city.

Think about how you write these locations as an address on an envelope. You would
separate the city, state, and country with commas.

```
 The Jones family moved from Portland, Oregon, to Billings, Montana. (Two
commas set off the state unless it appears at the end of the sentence.)
```

```
 The 12-hour flight from London, England, to Seattle, Washington, was filled with
business travelers. (Two commas set off the country unless it appears at the end
of the sentence.)
```

#### Contrasting Statements

Commas are used to set apart two related, but contrasting, statements. Contrasting
statements are often introduced by the words **not, never, but,** and **yet**. Not all
contrasting statements are preceded by these words. If the sentence contains
contrasting statements, separate the contrasting statements with commas.

```
 We chose to travel to London, not Paris, at the beginning of our honeymoon.
(The contrasting element appears in the middle of the sentence.)
 The more she complains, the more we ignore her. (One comma sets off a
contrasting statement at the end of the sentence.)
```

#### Clarity

Commas can help eliminate confusion in a sentence. Commas are used to separate
words that are repeated for emphasis. In addition, commas can be used between words
if it helps avoid confusion in the sentence.

```
 No matter what, they know they have our support. (Comma needed for clarity.)
 Most of the time, travelers bring a book or magazine to read. (Comma needed for
clarity.)
 They waited a very, very long time for a table at the restaurant. (Comma added
between the repeated words.)
```

#### Short Quotations

A comma is used before the quotation mark to set off a short quotation from the rest of
the sentence. If the quotation is divided into two parts, commas are used with each part
of the quotation.

```
 The instructor said, “The writing assignment is due on Friday.”
 “Discipline,” said Abraham Lincoln, “is choosing between what you want now and
what you want most.”
```

#### Degrees, Abbreviations, and Numbers

**Degrees and Abbreviations**
Degrees, personal titles, and professional titles are set off by commas. The
abbreviations Jr., Sr., and Roman numerals added to a person‟s name are not
separated with commas.

```
 David Johnson, PhD, will speak about the importance of grammar.
 Mary Elizabeth, MD, is currently accepting new patients.
 Fred Jones Sr. is the father of Fred Jones Jr.
```

**Company Abbreviations**
Some companies have the abbreviations Inc. and Ltd. in their company name. Inc. and
Ltd. are not set off with commas unless the company‟s legal name includes the
commas. (This is not common.)

```
 Pixar Inc. creates animated movies and short films. (no comma needed)
 Apple Inc. invented the iPhone. (no comma needed)
```

**Numbers**
To avoid potential confusion, use a comma when unrelated numbers appear side by
side in a sentence. Numbers of more than three digits require commas. Calendar
years, addresses, page numbers, decimal points, and zip codes do not require internal
commas.

```
 By 2015, 950 levels of Candy Crush will be available. (Two figures appearing
side by side are separated with a comma.)
 There were 1,780 people at the mall today. (Comma separates a number larger
than three digits.)
 Their zip code is 98052. (No internal comma needed in a zip code)
```

#### Quick List of Comma Rules

1. Use a comma to separate three or more items in a series.
 She likes apples, pears, bananas, and peaches.
2. Use a comma with a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) to separate
independent clauses.
 Fred likes to go out for dinner, but he also enjoys cooking dinner at home.
3. Use a comma to separate an introductory dependent clause from the
independent clause.
 Although it began to rain, we went for a walk around the neighborhood.
5. Use commas to separate two or more adjectives that describe the same noun.
Try inserting the word “and” between the adjectives and reverse the adjectives. If the
sentence still makes sense, then a comma is needed between the adjectives.
 She is an intelligent, capable student. (She is a capable and intelligent student.)
4. Use commas to set apart nonessential parenthetical elements in a sentence. It
is considered nonessential if it can be removed and the sentence still makes sense.
 Fred is, without a doubt, the best cook in the family.
5. Use commas to set apart elements in dates, geographical locations, addresses,
and titles in names.
 Nancy Johnson, MD, moved to Paris, France, on July 15, 2013, to complete her
residency.
6. Use commas to separate a short quotation from the rest of the sentence.
 Mary asked, “Who wants to go to Hawaii in December?” “I do,” said Sarah.
7. Use commas when necessary to prevent confusion.
 To Nancy, Kennedy was the most charismatic president.
8. Use commas when directly addressing someone.
 Let‟s eat, Grandma!
9. Use a comma when separating introductory words, such as yes, well, no, and
now.
 Yes, I will be at the conference in Las Vegas.
10. Use a comma to show contrasting statements.
 These are my shoes, not yours.
11. Use a comma when unrelated numbers appear side by side in a sentence.

```
 By September 2014, 13 new cafes will be opening on campus.
```

## Semicolons, Colons, and Other

## Punctuation

#### Semicolons

Many people were not taught how to properly use the semicolons, so they approach
semicolons with fear. Once you learn the tricks to using semicolons, you might wonder
how you wrote without them. Semicolons are a stronger piece of punctuation than the
comma. Use them in the following instances.

**Semicolons are used to connect two independent clauses.** Using a semicolon
signals that the two clauses are closely related. If the two independent clauses are not
closely related, then a semicolon is not the right choice.

```
 Winter quarter is almost finished; finals take place in two weeks. (Correct! These
two independent clauses are closely related.)
```

```
 Summer quarter begins in July; I like coffee. (Incorrect! These two independent
clauses are not closely related.)
```

Independent clauses can work as their own sentence. If the clause cannot function as
an independent sentence, then the semicolon is not the right choice. In addition, **never**
use coordinating conjunctions with semicolons. Semicolons and coordinating
conjunctions do not go together. You can think of them as oil and water; they do not
mix.

```
 The coffee shop closes at 9 p.m.; we need to hurry to get there in time. (Correct!
These two independent clauses are closely related.)
 The coffee shop closes at 9 p.m.; for lattes and scones. (Incorrect! The second
half of the sentence is a prepositional phrase and not an independent clause.)
 The coffee is better at the downtown location; but we can go to the Bellevue
location. (Incorrect! Semicolons and coordinating conjunctions are never used
together.)
```

**Semicolons are used to connect two independent clauses with the addition of a**
**conjunctive adverb.** Conjunctive adverbs provide a transition between one clause and
the next clause. A semicolon appears before the conjunctive adverb, and a comma
appears after longer conjunctive adverbs. Common conjunctive adverbs include the
following: _accordingly, consequently, for example, furthermore, however, likewise,_
_moreover, nevertheless, otherwise,_ and _therefore_. Shorter conjunctive adverbs like
_then, thus,_ and _hence_ do not require the additional comma.

```
 Fred worked on his writing assignment for two days; consequently, he received a
high score from his instructor.
 She did not attend class for two weeks; consequently, she missed a lot of
information that was on the exam.
 Mary updated her Facebook status before the movie started; hence she had
many notifications when she turned her phone back on. (No comma needed after
hence.)
```

**Semicolons are used to separate items in a series when those items already have**
**commas.** Usually you only use commas to separate items in a series, but when the
items already contain commas, semicolons are added for clarity.

```
 We traveled to Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; and Madrid, Spain. (Semicolons
separate the locations, which are already written as city, country.)
 Mary has lived in Billings, Montana; Portland, Oregon; Orlando, Florida; and New
York, New York. (Semicolons separate the locations, which are written with
internal commas separating the city and the state.)
```

**Semicolons are used to separate three or more independent clauses that appear**
**in a series.** These sentences can be long and wordy. If the sentence becomes too
cumbersome, it is time to rewrite it.

```
 The first coffeehouse offered delicious coffee and scones; the second
coffeehouse offered only coffee; and the third coffeehouse offered coffee,
muffins, and music.
```

#### Colons

**The colon is used to introduce lists, quotations, and explanations.** Colons alert the
reader that a list or an explanation follows. The information after the colon will list,
explain, or clarify the information that appeared before the colon. Colons are only used
after statements that are complete sentences. Never use a colon after a phrase or a
fragment.

**Use a colon after an independent clause that introduces a list of one or more**
**items**. All of the words to the left of a colon must form an independent clause. If it does
not form an independent clause, then do not use a colon. A list can be introduced by
such words as _the following, as follows, these,_ or _thus_. A list can be written vertically or
horizontally. Do not let the formatting confuse you. The rules still apply to colons even
when the sentence is written as a vertical list.

When writing lists in sentence form, do not capitalize the first letter after the colon
unless it is a proper noun. When using a colon in a vertical list, capitalize the first letter
of each item on the list.

```
 Fred‟s favorite cities to visit are the following: New York, San Diego, and New
Orleans. (Do not place the colon after “are” because it is a verb. You can usually
add “the following” to make the phrase an independent clause.)
```

```
 She had only one request that morning: coffee. (Colon introduces the one item
on her list.)
```

```
 During November and December, Starbucks offers the following coffee
beverages:
o Pumpkin Spice Lattes
o Peppermint Lattes
o Peppermint Mochas
```

```
 Mary‟s favorite cities are
o Paris
o London
o Prague
```

```
(No colon is used for this list because the sentence would not form an
independent clause before the colon.)
```

**Use a colon to introduce long one-sentence quotations and quotations longer**
**than one sentence.** The entire quotation needs to be inside the quotation marks,
including the sentence punctuation.

```
 Maria Robinson said: “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but
anyone can start today and make a new ending.” (Long one-sentence quotation
introduced with a colon.)
```

Long quotations that fill more than three lines should be moved to a separate paragraph
without quotation marks. The paragraph should be indented on the right and the left,
and the quotation should be separated from the rest of the text with a blank line before
and after the paragraph. Indentation and blank lines separate the quotation from the
rest of the text.

```
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only
way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great
work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you
do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As
with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
--Steve Jobs
```

**Use a colon to connect two independent clauses if the second clause explains or**
**supplements the first clause.** If the information after the colon does not explain or
illustrate the first clause, then a semicolon is a better punctuation choice.

```
 The team faced a huge problem: their uniforms did not arrive in time for the
game. (What was their huge problem? The second clause explains what the
“huge problem” is.)
```

**Colons are used after the salutation of a business letter.**

```
 Dear Mr. Smith:
 Dear Dr. Mary Jones:
 To Whom it May Concern:
```

**Colons are used to separate hours and minutes.**

```
 10:59 p.m.
 6:30 a.m.
```

**Colons are used to separate the title and the subtitle of books, articles, and other**
**publications.**

```
 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‟t Stop Talking (book title)
 Woe is I: The Grammarphobe‟s Guide to Better English in Plain English (book
title)
```

#### Periods

Periods are most commonly used to end a sentence, but periods have other uses too.
**Do not double space after periods unless you are typing on a typewriter.** Modern
word processing adds the appropriate space after a period. If you double space your
document, you will end up with a lot of white space in your text.

**Use a period at the end of a sentence that is a statement, a command, or an**
**indirect question.** This is the most familiar way to use a period. Indirect questions can
be challenging because the sentence might sound like a question. The sentence may
even contain the word _question._ If the statement contains the word _wonder_ or _question_,
look closely at the sentence to determine if the sentence is an indirect question or a
direct question.

 The campus cafe was closed yesterday. (statement)
 Turn in your writing assignment by midnight on Friday. (command)
 The instructor asked if there were any questions. (indirect question)
 The students wondered when the sun would come out again. (indirect question)
**Use a period to punctuate a polite request or suggestion.** Polite requests look a lot
like questions, but they are really commands. Polite requests add the words _can, may,_
_will, could,_ and _would_ to soften a command. The result is a command that sounds a lot
like a suggestion. Polite requests are a way to command action in a less pushy way.
Because these sentences are commands, they cannot be answered with a simple _yes_
or _no_ reply. A polite request is asking for action.

```
 May I suggest that you prepare your writing assignment early in the week. (polite
suggestion)
 Will you please let me know if you have any questions. (polite request)
 Could you please arrive ten minutes early for your appointment. (polite request)
```

Punctuating polite requests can be confusing. As the writer, you have control over how
the sentence is written. Rewrite the sentence as a statement if a period seems
awkward.

```
 I suggest that you prepare your writing assignment early in the week. (polite
request rewritten as a statement)
 Let me know if you have any questions. (polite request rewritten as a statement)
 Please arrive ten minutes early for your appointment. (polite request rewritten as
a statement)
```

**Use periods to punctuate lower case abbreviations.**

```
 a.m. (ante meridiem)
 p.m. (post meridiem)
 ft. (foot or feet)
 Ave. (avenue)
 St. (street)
 EXCEPTIONS: mph (miles per hour), wpm (words per minute)
```

**Use periods to punctuate abbreviations containing capital and lowercase letters.**

```
 Dr. (Doctor)
 Mr. (Mister)
 Mrs. (Misses)
 Est. (Established)
```

**No periods are used to punctuate abbreviations containing all capital letters.**
Businesses, organizations, academic degrees, geographic areas, television stations,
federal agencies, and professional certificates do not use periods.

```
 NBC (National Broadcasting Company)
 NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)
 IPO (Initial Public Offering)
 AA (Associate of Arts degree)
 FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation)
 USA (United States of America)
 EXCEPTION: use periods and spaces when single initials are used to abbreviate
a person‟s name, such as J. K. Rowling.
 EXCEPTION: use periods when United States is abbreviated and used as an
adjective (U.S. government)
```

**Punctuating after an abbreviation**
If the abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, you do not add an additional
period to the end of the sentence. If your sentence ends with a different punctuation
mark, then the period and the additional punctuation mark are used together. This is
grammatically correct, but it looks awkward. In these cases, it is often better to rewrite
your sentence.

```
 Dave‟s flight was scheduled to depart at 9:35 a.m. (no extra period needed)
 Did you mark the course in ft. or yds.? (period used for abbreviation and question
mark used to end the question)
```

```
 Did you mark the course in feet or yards? (rewritten using the words feet and
yards instead of their abbreviations)
```

#### Question Marks

**Use a question mark to punctuate a direct question.**

```
 Have you seen my keys?
 What do you want for dinner?
```

**Use a question mark to punctuate tag questions added to statements.** These
questions are added to the end of a statement and turn the entire sentence into a
question.

```
 The cafe serves the best coffee, don‟t they?
 That was the best movie, don‟t you think?
 You didn‟t forget your wallet again, did you?
```

**Use a question mark to punctuate statements that are meant to be read as**
**question or to show surprise.** Adding a question mark changes the meaning of the
sentence. If you want the sentence to be read as a question, then add a question mark.

```
 We are going out at midnight. (statement)
 We are going out at midnight? (The question mark changes the meaning of the
sentence. Why are we going out at midnight?)
 The shoes cost $300. (statement)
 The shoes cost $300? (The question mark changes the meaning of the
sentence.)
```

**Use a question mark within parentheses to show doubt or uncertainty.**

```
 She graduated from college (1996?) after years of studying.
 He started his job a few years ago (2010?).
```

#### Exclamation Points

The exclamation point expresses strong emotions, excitement, horror, urgency, and
panic. Use it sparingly to avoid the impression that you are shouting.

```
 Wow! I won the lottery!
 That is amazing!
```

#### Hyphens

Hyphens reveal a connection between words. It alerts the reader that these words go
together. The connection can change the meaning of the sentence.

```
 The doctors worked twenty-four-hour shifts. (The doctors worked around the
clock.)
 The doctors worked twenty four-hour shifts. (The doctors worked twenty separate
four-hour shifts.)
 The doctors worked twenty-four hour shifts. (The doctors worked twenty-four
separate hour-long shifts.)
```

**Use a hyphen to create compound nouns, verbs, and adjectives.**

```
 up-to-date
 first-class
 brother-in-law
 double-space
 full-time
```

**Use a hyphen to create words with the following prefixes: ex, self, or quasi.**

```
 He is our quasi-official leader.
 She has a lot of self-esteem.
 The ex-president of the company was invited to the meeting.
```

**Use a hyphen to write family titles that contain ex, great, or in-law. The prefixes**
**step, half, or grand are not hyphenated.**

```
 great-grandmother
 mother-in-law
 half brother
 stepsister
 stepbrother
```

**Use a hyphen to divide a word over two lines.** This rule only applies if you are
working on a typewriter. Most word processing software will adjust the spacing, and
move the word to the next line.

#### Dashes

Be careful not to confuse dashes and hyphens. They might look very similar, but they
are different. You can think of them as twins, but even human twins get annoyed when
you cannot tell them apart.

Where is the dash located on the keyboard? The dash is not on a standard keyboard.
You form a dash by typing two hyphens with no space between them, no spaces before
them, and no spaces after them. Most software will convert the two hyphens to a dash.
This dash is also called the em dash. (The dash is the length of the letter m.) If your
software does not convert to the dash, two hyphens working as a dash is acceptable.

The dash is used instead of a comma, semicolon, colon, or parentheses in order to
show greater emphasis. The dash is more dramatic than the comma or parentheses.
Because the dash is used to show emphasis and drama, do not overuse it.

To remember that a dash shows greater emphasis and drama, think of the meaning of
the word “dash.” If someone is dashing to class, they are in a big hurry. It is more
dramatic than just walking to class. The dash alerts the reader that the following
information is dramatic.

**Use a dash to set off parenthetical elements and appositives.** Usually parenthetical
elements and appositives are set apart from the sentence with commas. Commas are
the standard way to set apart parenthetical elements in a sentence. Use dashes or
parentheses to set apart parenthetical elements that contain internal commas. Be aware
that using dashes will emphasize the parenthetical element. Parentheses de-emphasize
the parenthetical element.

```
 Three students--Sam Jones, Fred Johnson, and Dave Smith--received awards at
the conference. (Parenthetical element contains internal commas. Dashes used
for clarity.)
 Three desserts--cheesecake, macarons, and ice cream--were available at the
meeting. (Parenthetical element contains internal commas. Dashes used for
clarity.)
```

If you place parenthetical elements between dashes instead of commas, it emphasizes
the parenthetical element.

```
 All students--including Sam Jones--must take the test again. (Parenthetical
element is emphasized.)
```

```
 All of the desserts--especially the cheesecake--were devoured by the students.
(Parenthetical element is emphasized.)
```

**Use a dash to show an interruption of thought, an abrupt change of thought, or an**
**afterthought.** This is an abrupt form of punctuation for an afterthought. It is often better
to rewrite the sentence.

```
 I will call you tomorrow--if that is okay with you--to discuss our plans. (Interruption
of a thought)
 Let‟s meet for coffee on Thursday--no, let‟s meet Friday instead. (Abrupt change
of thought. Rewriting would improve this sentence.)
```

**Use a dash to connect an introductory list with a summarizing statement.** If this
seems awkward, you can rewrite the sentence without the dash.

```
 Angry Birds, Words With Friends, Candy Crush--these are some of the most
popular iPhone games. (with the dash)
 Angry Birds, Words With Friends, and Candy Crush are some of the most
popular iPhone games. (No dash. Coordinating conjunction added to connect the
list to the summary.)
```

**Use a dash to attribute a quotation.** The dash immediately precedes the source of the
quotation. The dash and source should appear on a separate line and aligned to the
right.

```
 Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than
any other one thing.
--Abraham Lincoln
```

#### Parentheses

Parentheses are always used in pairs to enclose a complete sentence, a word, a
number, or an expression.

**Use parentheses to set apart parenthetical or nonessential sentence elements.**
There are three ways to punctuate parenthetical elements. Dashes emphasize the
nonessential information the most. Parentheses emphasize the nonessential
information the least. Commas neither emphasize nor de-emphasize the information.

```
 The advertisement, which appears on page 5, has a major spelling error. (Normal
punctuation of nonessential information. The parenthetical element is not
emphasized or de-emphasized.)
 The advertisement--which appears on page 5--has a major spelling error. (Strong
emphasis placed on the parenthetical information.)
 The advertisement (which appears on page 5) has a major spelling error. (Least
emphasis placed on the parenthetical information.)
```

**Use parentheses to enclose numbers in formal documents.** In legal, business, and
formal documents, numbers usually appear in both word and numeral form. Using the
written form of the number and the numeral form should be reserved for formal
documents.

```
 Payment is due in thirty (30) days.
 The boat cost twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).
```

**Use parentheses to enclose numbers or letters that list items in a sentence.** Use
numbers to list items that require a specific order. Letters are used for lists that do not
require a specific order.

```
 To register for the marathon, (1) log on to our website, (2) select the marathon
you want to race, (3) select the form of payment you want to use, (4) enter
payment, and (5) click the submit button to complete your purchase.
 The website offered several tips for marathon training, including (a) wear
appropriate running shoes, (b) break in new shoes before the race, (c)
incorporate a rest day every week, and (d) stretching is required.
```

**Parentheses and Sentence Punctuation**
If the entire sentence is inside parentheses, then the period is also inside the
parentheses.

```
 (Check Canvas for all upcoming due dates.)
 (See page 5 for more information.)
```

If only part of the sentence is enclosed with parentheses, and that section appears at
the end of the sentence; then the punctuation stays outside of the parentheses.
Semicolons, colons, and commas that appear in the sentence stay outside of the
parentheses.

```
 Sarah will travel to Hawaii next week (June 4). (The period is outside the
parentheses.)
```

```
 When we start Spring quarter (April 7), the weather will be warmer. (Comma is
outside the parentheses)
```

If a complete sentence appears in parentheses, and the parenthetical sentence is
embedded inside another sentence, do not capitalize the first letter of the parenthetical
sentence. If the sentence in parentheses requires a question mark or an exclamation
point, then the punctuation needs to be inside the parentheses. Periods are never
added to sentences that are inside parentheses embedded within other sentences.

```
 We tried the new restaurant (have you tried it?) last night. (A question is
embedded within another sentence. Use a question mark inside the parentheses.
Do not capitalize the first letter of the sentence inside parentheses.)
 Dave ordered the sock soup (yuck!), and I ordered pizza. (An exclamation is
embedded within the sentence. Use an exclamation point inside the parentheses.
Do not capitalize the first letter of the sentence inside the parentheses.)
 After dinner, we went to the beach (we wanted to digest our food before going
home) to watch the sunset. (A complete sentence is embedded within the
sentence. Do not add a period to this sentence! Do not capitalize the first letter of
the sentence inside the parentheses.)
```

#### Quotation Marks

Quotation marks always appear in pairs. One quotation mark appears at the beginning
and one appears at the end. Quotation marks never appear alone.

**Use quotation marks to enclose words that are direct quotations.** Quotation marks
imply that these are the exact words spoken. Unless the words are a direct quotation,
do not use quotation marks.

```
 “When you‟re curious, you find lots of interesting things to do,” said Walt Disney.
(direct quote enclosed in quotation marks)
 Walt Disney said that curiosity and imagination are important. (indirect quotation
requires no quotation marks)
```

**Use quotation marks to enclose the titles of magazine articles, songs, short**
**stories, television episodes, or a chapter of a larger book.**

```
 The kids love the song “In Summer” from the movie Frozen.
 Dave‟s favorite episode of Lost was “The Constant.”
```

**Quotation Marks and Punctuation**
**Periods and commas are always placed inside the quotation marks**.

```
 The kids keep singing “Let It Go.” (period inside the quotation mark)
 Mary said, “We need to go to the store.” (period inside the quotation mark)
 Fred said, “Order me a latte,” but Mary accidently ordered him a mocha. (comma
is inside the quotation marks)
```

**Colons and semicolons are always placed outside the quotation marks.**

```
 Fred said, “Order me a latte”; Mary accidently ordered him a mocha. (semicolon
appears outside the quotation marks)
 The following characters appeared in the episode “The Constant”: Kate, Jack,
Desmond, and Locke.
```

Question marks and exclamation point can be placed inside or outside the quotation
mark, but it is determined by the sentence. Question marks and exclamation points are
placed inside the quotation mark if they are part of the quotation. If the quotation is a
question, then the question mark is placed inside the quotation mark. If the sentence
asks a question, but not the quotation, then the question mark is outside the quotation
mark.

```
 Dave asked, “What do you want for dinner?” (The question mark is part of the
quotation. An additional punctuation mark is not needed.)
 What do you think she meant when she said, “The fish tank is on fire”? (The
entire sentence is a question. The quotation is not a question. The question mark
is placed outside the quotation mark.)
```

#### Italics

**Use italics for the titles of books, magazines, movies, shows, plays, newspapers,**
**and music albums.**

```
 Newsweek published the article about education. (Magazine title is in italics)
 Friends was a popular television show in the 1990s. (Television show title is in
italics)
```

**Use italics for words or phrases used as examples in your sentence.** Using italics,
you can write about a specific word, without including the meaning of the word in your
sentence.
 People should know that _irregardless_ is not a real word. (Use italics to refer to
words in a sentence without using their meaning in a sentence)
 Many people confuse the words _lay_ and _lie_. (Use italics to refer to words in a
sentence without using their meaning in the sentence)

**Use italics for slang words.** Some people prefer to use quotation marks. It is a
personal preference.

```
 Andy thought the dessert was epic! (Slang)
 Ava‟s soccer goal was wicked. (Slang)
```

#### Brackets

**Use brackets to set apart editorial comments within a quotation.** The comments
inside the brackets can include additional information or corrections. The most common
use for brackets is to enclose the word _sic_ inside brackets following an error in a
quotation. _Sic_ is a Latin word meaning _thus_ or _so_. By putting the word _sic_ in brackets, it
acknowledges that there is an error in the quotation, but the quotation is exactly how the
speaker said it.

```
 He said, “I want to go too [sic] the store!”
 The coach wrote the article “We can‟t loose [sic] the game” for the local
newspaper.
 “Your vacation package price [$3,960] also includes all meals and beverages.”
```

#### Apostrophes

**Use an apostrophe to form possessive nouns.** Apostrophes show ownership or
origin. Apostrophes never make a noun plural.

```
 Fred‟s motorcycle (motorcycle belongs to Fred)
 Ava‟s toys (the toys belonging to Ava)
 The Joneses‟ house (the house belonging to the Jones family)
```

**Use an apostrophe to form contractions.** Contractions are shortened words that
formed by joining two words. An apostrophe takes the place of the missing letters.

```
 Can‟t (contraction of cannot)
 Won‟t (contraction of will not)
 Could‟ve (contraction of could have)
 It‟s (contraction of it is or it has)
```

**Use an apostrophe in place of omitted letters or numbers.**

```
 „70s (1970s)
 Class of „14 (class of 2014)
```

**Use an apostrophe as the symbol for feet in measurement.** The quotation mark is
used as the symbol for inches.

```
 The room is 15‟ x 25‟. (15 feet by 25 feet)
 She is 5‟ 4” tall. (5 feet four inches)
```

## Capitalization

Capitalization makes a big difference in the meaning of your sentence. It is the
difference between living in the white house and living in the White House. There are a
lot of capitalization rules. The trick is to be aware that there are a lot of rules and know
when reference a dictionary or style guide.

Do not capitalize words to emphasize them. It is not grammatically correct, and there
are better ways to emphasize your point. In addition, do not type documents in all
capital letters. Writing in all capitals gives the impression that the writer is shouting. It is
considered rude.

When capitalizing nouns, only capitalize the first letter of the word. It is correct to write
_Washington_ and incorrect to write _WASHINGTON_. Only the first letter should be
capitalized. Abbreviations are exceptions to this rule.

**Capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence.** If your sentence begins with
a company name that is not capitalized, it is better to rewrite your sentence.

```
 The Apple iPhone is a very popular smartphone.
 iPhones are very popular smartphones. (Technically correct, but it looks so
awkward that it is better to rewrite it.)
```

**Capitalize the pronoun I.** It is never correct to use the pronoun _I_ as a lowercase letter.

```
 If I were you, I would turn in the writing assignment on time.
 Dave and I enjoy drinking coffee.
```

**Capitalize proper nouns.** Proper nouns name specific people, places, or things.
People‟s names are always capitalized. Company names, product names, and
nicknames are all capitalized. Historical events are always capitalized. Specific
academic courses are capitalized, but the general subject is only capitalized if it
contains a proper noun. If the noun names something very specific, then it must be
capitalized.

```
 Specific names: Edmonds Community College, Eastern Washington University,
and Cascadia Community College are all capitalized because they name specific
colleges.
 Specific companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Boeing, and Alaska Airlines
 Historical events: World War I, World War II, and the Great Depression
 Specific products: PowerPoint, Excel, and Word
 Specific academic courses: Accounting 101, English 102, and History 205. The
general subjects of accounting, English, and history are not capitalized unless
the subject contains a proper noun like English.
```

**Capitalize geographic locations.** The names of specific cities, counties, states,
countries, continents, lakes, rivers, oceans, and mountains are capitalized. The word
_city_ is only capitalized if it is included in the official name of the city. Salt Lake City
includes the word _city_ in its official name, so it is capitalized.

```
 Specific geographic locations: Lake Washington, Lake Erie, and Lake Tahoe
 Specific countries: France, Canada, Spain, and Italy
 Specific continents: North America, South America, Africa, and Asia
```

**Capitalize the name of specific celestial bodies.** Do not capitalize sun or moon.
Many planets have suns and moons, so these are common nouns. Earth is sometimes
capitalized and sometimes lowercased. When it shows up in a list of other planets,
Earth is capitalized. If it refers to space, Earth is capitalized. If the meaning refers to
something other than space travel or our specific planet, then it is lowercase.

```
 Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Earth are all planets in the solar system.
 Why on earth did you do that?
 The beauty queen wished for peace on earth.
```

**Capitalize days, months, and holidays.** Seasons are lowercase unless they are
included in a proper noun. Seasons that are combined with a year are considered
proper nouns because it refers to a specific season.

```
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are all capitalized because they
name specific days.
 Mary loves summer days. (Summer is not capitalized because it is a common
noun.)
 The Fall 2014 course catalog will be available soon. (Fall is capitalized because it
is combined with the year to form a proper noun.)
```

**Capitalize the first word and all main words naming specific newspapers,**
**journals, books, and articles.** Do not capitalize the conjunctions _(and, but)_,
prepositions _(to, of, for)_, and articles _(a, an, the)_ unless they are the first word in the title.

```
 Grammar Girl Presents the Ultimate Writing Guide for Students is a great
grammar book.
 Capital in the Twenty-First Century is currently on top of the New York Times
best seller list, but it is not a book about capital letters.
```

**Capitalize formal titles (political, professional, military, nobility) that appear**
**before someone’s name.** Formal titles that appear after someone‟s name are not
capitalized. The titles Mr., Mrs., Miss, and Dr. are capitalized when they appear before
someone‟s name. If the title appears before the person‟s name, then it is part of their
official title. If the title appears after their name, it is only describing their role, and
should not be capitalized. It is correct to say that Queen Elizabeth is a queen. Her title is
capitalized because it appears before her name and is part of her official title. The
second _queen_ is lower case because it is only describing her role. The distinction is
whether the title is part of their official name or if it is a common reference to their
generalized role.

```
 In October President Obama invited several former presidents to the White
House.
 The conference had many impressive speakers, including Dr. Smith and
Professor Jones.
 Prince William and Prince Harry are princes.
```

**Capitalize family titles only if they precede the person’s name or are substituting**
**for a person’s name**. Aunt Sarah and Uncle Al are both capitalized because the title
precedes their names. A broad reference to aunts, uncles, and cousins is not
capitalized because it does not refer to a specific person. If the family title is preceded
by a modifier, such as a possessive pronoun (my, his, her, our), then the family title is
not capitalized.

```
 She is a mother now. (Mother is not capitalized because it refers to a generalized
role.)
 Say hello to Dad for me. (Dad is capitalized because this is his name in this
sentence.)
 Aunt Sarah and Uncle Al were invited to the party. (The titles precede their
names)
 Her aunt and uncle were invited to the party. (The family titles are preceded by
possessive pronouns.)
 Andy has eight cousins. (Cousins is not capitalized because it is a general
reference and not part of someone‟s name.)
```

**Capitalize specific religions and nationalities.**

```
 Religions: Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Judaism.
 Nationalities: American, French, British, Korean, Japanese, and Russian.
```

**Capitalize direction names if they are referring to a specific location**. Do not
capitalize compass directions if they are used to describe a direction.

```
 Specific regions that include direction names: the Middle East, the East
Coast, the Northern Hemisphere, Western Washington, and the South.
 General compass directions are lower case: travel south, drive east, turn
north, and walk west.
```

**Capitalize the main words naming specific departments, bureaus, divisions,**
**agencies, and committees.** If the noun refers to a general committee or agency, then it
is not capitalized.

```
 Mary is involved in many committees. (General reference to many committees.)
 Fred called the Customer Service Department. (Refers to a specific department)
 The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is a division of the United States
Department of the Treasury. (Refers to a specific bureau and department)
 The Accounting Department handles payroll. (Refers to a specific department)
 Microsoft‟s Xbox Division is very profitable. (Refers to a specific division)
```

**Capitalize the first word in a quotation.**

```
 The instructor said, “Turn in your writing assignments.”
 Dave said, “Do not forget to buy coffee at the store.”
```

**Capitalize the first word of each item in a vertical list.**

The instructor covered the following topics in class today:
 Action verbs
 Transitive verbs
 Intransitive verbs
 Linking verbs

**Capitalize the names of specific amendments, bills, laws, and treaties.**

```
 The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 and ended WWI.
 The Bill of Rights is the collective name of the first ten amendments to the U.S.
Constitution.
 The Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in cases involving more than
twenty dollars.
 The Affordable Care Act received a lot of coverage in the media.
 They need to work out a peace treaty. (Not capitalized because this is a general
reference to a treaty and does not name a specific treaty)
```

## Numbers

Why are there numbers in a grammar book? Writing numbers correctly in a sentence is
a grammar issue and not a math issue.

**When writing numbers as figures, use a comma to separate groups of three**
**digits**. This adds clarity to the numbers. This rule does not apply to phone numbers,
addresses, zip codes, serial numbers, account numbers, and page numbers.

```
 The balance on the account is $14,300.
 Her zip code is 98052.
```

**The numbers one through ten are written out as words. Numbers above ten are**
**written as numerals.** This is referred to as the Rule of Ten.

```
 The fruit bowl contains two bananas and three apples.
 The class has 23 students.
```

If numbers under ten and over ten are used in the same sentence, use numerals for all
numbers. The highest number in the sentence sets the rule for all of the numbers in the
sentence.

```
 The fruit bowl contains 2 bananas, 3 apples, and 14 apricots. (The highest
number sets the rule for the sentence.)
 The class has 2 instructors and 23 students. (The highest number sets the rule
for the sentence.)
```

**Numbers that begin sentences are written out as words**. If the written out number
consists of more than two words, spare the reader and rewrite your sentence.

```
 Three students submitted the assignment early.
 Three thousand four hundred and fifteen people attended the conference.
(Rewrite! This sentence is too cumbersome.)
 The conference was attended by 3,415 people. (Better!)
```

It is acceptable to begin a sentence with a number if that number refers to a calendar
year.

```
 2011 was a busy year for the family.
```

**Money**
**Use numbers to express amounts of money.** A decimal point is unnecessary in
whole dollar amounts. For clarity, always include a comma in dollar amounts of $1,000
or more. Use a dollar sign and a decimal point for monetary figures less than $1 if they
are listed in a sentence with items that are more than $1. If all monetary figures are less
than $1, it is acceptable to write the amounts as cents. Do not use the cents symbol.

```
 The invoice showed charges of $25.99, $20, $.75, and $1,212.25.
 The bake sale sold items for $.25, $.75, and $3.
 The bananas cost 75 cents each.
```

**Dates**
**Use numbers (1, 2, 3) if the date follows the month**. Do not use _th, nd, rd_, or _st_ after
the figure if the date follows the calendar month. Some word processing programs,

including Microsoft Word, automatically change the dates to the ordinal numbers (1st,
2nd, 3rd). Be aware that some programs will do this and delete the ordinal numbers
when necessary.

```
 May 17, 2008, was an exceptionally warm day in Seattle.
 They are scheduled to arrive on July 2, 2014.
```

**Use ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd) if the date precedes the month or if the date is**
**used without the month.**

```
 Seattle was exceptionally warm on the 17th of May.
 They are scheduled to arrive on the 2nd.
```

**Addresses**
**Use numerals for address numbers except for the number One**. Use numbers for
zip codes, address numbers, suite numbers, apartment numbers, or route numbers.

```
 Her address is One Elm Street, Apt. 2, Redmond, WA 98052.
 His address is 7319 Maple Drive, Suite 310, Edmonds, WA 98020.
```

**Street names numbered ten and below are written out as words (First, Second,**
**Third)**. Street names numbered greater than ten are written as ordinal numbers (11th,
12th, 13th).

```
 301 First Ave South
 18061 85th Ave North
 2025 Second Street
```

**Adjacent Numbers**
**When two numbers appear side-by-side in a sentence, write the first number in**
**words and second number as a numeral.** If the first number cannot be written in two
words or fewer, it is acceptable to write out the number that can be written in fewer
words. If both numbers are long, rewrite the sentence.

```
 The opera was divided into four 30-minute acts.
 The light fixture required ten 120-watt bulbs.
 The campus dorms consist of twelve 200-unit apartments.
```

**Time**
**Use numbers to express time with a.m. and p.m.**

```
 The meeting starts at 11 a.m.
 The meeting starts at eleven a.m. (Incorrect)
```

**Numbers or words can precede o’clock, in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the**
**evening.**

```
 The meeting starts at 11 o‟clock in the morning. (Acceptable)
 The meeting starts at eleven o‟clock in the morning. (Acceptable)
```

Use one way to express time in a document and remain consistent. Do not use more
than one way to express a single unit of time.

```
 The meeting starts at 11 a.m. in the morning. (Incorrect. This is redundant
because a.m. already explains that this time is in the morning.)
```

**Measurements**
**Use numbers to express weights, measurements, and temperatures.**

```
 Fred‟s flight to Seattle took 7 hours and 35 minutes.
 Seattle reached 75 degrees Fahrenheit today.
 The recipe requires 12 ounces of cheese.
```

**Large numbers**
**Use a combination of numbers and words to express large numbers. It is easier**
**to read as a combination.**

```
 Cleveland, Ohio‟s Balloon Fest released 1.4 million balloons into the air in 1986.
 In 2013 the state of Washington had 6.97 million residents.
```

**Percentages**
**Use numbers to express percentages and spell out the word percent.** The percent
sign (%) is only used in technical documents and tables.

```
 Our profits increased 10 percent last quarter.
 The flight arrives early 85 percent of the time.
 Mary received a 25 percent discount.
```

**Fractions**
**Simple fractions are written as words when they can be expressed in two words**
**and when it is the only fraction in a sentence.**

```
 One fourth of the class turned in the assignment early.
 We ate one half of the cookies before the party.
```

**Use numbers to express long fractions, mixed fractions (whole numbers and**
**fractions together), and multiple fractions within the same sentence.** An extra
space is added between the whole number and the fraction.

```
 The room measured 12 ½ feet by 18 ½ feet.
 The smartphone was only ⅝ of an inch thick.
```

**Decimals**
**Use numbers to express figures with decimals.** If the figure is less than zero, a zero
is placed before the decimal point.

```
 Phoenix had 0.05 inches of rain last month. (Zero is placed before decimal point
because the amount is less than zero.)
 Seattle had 3.2 inches of rain last week.
```

**Grades, scores, voting results**
**Use numbers to express grades, scores, and voting results.** When writing scores,
place a hyphen between the winning and losing scores.

```
 The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43-8.
 Mary earned a 99 on her writing assignment.
 The vote was 5-to-3 favoring the expansion.
```

**Company Names, Organization Names, and Product Names**
Some companies, organizations, and products have numbers in their legal business
names. Write the name exactly how the organization writes it, even if it defies all of the
rules regarding numbers.

```
 7 For All Mankind
 7-Eleven
 24 Hour Fitness
 Super 8
 A1 Steak Sauce
 Pac-12
 Big Ten
```
